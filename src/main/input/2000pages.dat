<title>10G-EPON</title>
<text>The term '''10G-EPON''' refers to '''10 Gbit/s Ethernet Passive Optical Network''' standard, [[IEEE]] 802.3av<ref>[http://www.ieee802.org/3/av/ IEEE P802.3av Task Force]</ref>. The standard supports two configurations: ''symmetric'', operating at 10 Gbit/s data rate in both upstream and downstream directions, and ''asymmetric'', operating at 10 Gbit/s in the downstream direction and 1 Gbit/s in the upstream direction.

== Standardization Timeline ==
In March 2006, IEEE 802.3 working group held call for interest (CFI) for 10 Gbit/s EPON study group. According to the CFI materials, representatives from the following companies supported the formation of the study group<ref>[http://www.ieee802.org/3/cfi/0306_1/cfi_0306_1.pdf "10Gb/s PHY for EPON - Call For Interest Presentation]</ref>:

By September 2006, the study group has completed its charter and IEEE 802.3 formed the 802.3av task force to produce the draft standard for 10 Gbit/s EPON. In September 2009, the IEEE 802 Plenary ratified the amendment to 802.3 to make 802.3av a standard.

The following are the major milestones in 10 Gbit/s EPON study group:

== Architecture ==
=== Symmetric 10 Gb/s EPON (10/10G-EPON) ===
Symmetric-rate 10/10G-EPON supports transmit and receive data paths operating at 10 Gbit/s.  The main driver for 10/10G-EPON is the necessity to provide adequate downstream and upstream bandwidth to support the [[Multi-Dwelling Unit|MDU]] environment. When deployed in the [[Multi-Dwelling Unit|MDU]] configuration, one EPON ONU may be connected to up to a thousand subscribers. 

The 10/10G-EPON employs a number of functions that are common to other point-to-point Ethernet standards.  For example, such functions as 64B/66B line coding, self-synchronizing scrambler, or gearbox are also used in 10GBASE-SR, 10GBASE-LR, 10GBASE-ER, 10GBASE-LRM, and 10GBASE-KR types of Ethernet links.

=== Asymmetric 10 Gb/s EPON (10/1G-EPON) ===

The asymmetric 10/1G-EPON appear less challenging than the symmetric option, as this specification relies on fairly mature technologies.  The upstream transmission is identical to that of the existing 1G-EPON (as specified in IEEE Std. 802.3ah), and will rely on field-proven and mass deployed burst-mode optical transceivers. The downstream transmission, which uses continuous-mode optics, will rely on the maturity of 10 Gbit/s point-to-point Ethernet devices.

=== Power budgets ===
The 802.3av defines several power budgets, denoted either PR or PRX.  PRX power budget describes asymmetric–rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit/s downstream and 1 Gbit/s upstream.  PR power budget describes symmetric–rate PHY for PON operating at 10 Gbit/s downstream and 10 Gbit/s upstream.  Each power budget is further identified with a numeric representation of its class, where value of 10 represents low power budget, value of 20 represents medium power budget, and value of 30 represents high power budget.  The 802.3av draft standard defines the following power budgets:

=== Forward error correction ===

The 10G-EPON employs a ''stream-based'' forward error correction (FEC) mechanism based on Reed Solomon(255, 223). The FEC is mandatory for all channels operating at 10 Gbit/s rate, i.e., both downstream and upstream channels in symmetric 10 Gbit/s EPON and the downstream channel in the 10/1 Gbit/s asymmetric EPON. (Upstream channel in the asymmetric EPON is the same as in 1 Gbit/s EPON, i.e., optional frame-based FEC using RS(255, 239).)

== Backward compatibility ==

The 10G-EPON standard defines a new physical layer, keeping the MAC, MAC Control and all the layers above unchanged to the greatest extent possible.  This means that users of 10G-EPON can expect backward compatibility of network management system (NMS), PON-layer operations, administrations, and maintenance (OAM) system, DBA and scheduling, and so on.

=== Coexistence with 1G-EPON ===

The 802.3av standard places significant emphasis on enabling simultaneous operation of 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s EPON systems on the same outside plant. In the downstream direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels are separated in the wavelength domain, with 1 Gbit/s transmission limited to 1480-1500 nm band and 10 Gbit/s transmission using 1575-1580 nm band. 

In the upstream direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s bands overlap. 1 Gbit/s band spreads from 1260 to {{convert|1360|nmi|km|abbr=on}}; 10 Gbit/s band uses 1260 to {{convert|1280|nmi|km|abbr=on}} band.  This allows both upstream channels to share spectrum region characterized by low chromatic disperson, but requires the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels to be separated in time domain. Since burst transmissions from different ONUs now may have different line rates, this method is termed ''dual-rate TDMA''.

Various OLT implementations may support 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s transmissions only downstream direction, only upstream direction, or in both downstream and upstream directions. The following table illustrates which ONU types are simultaneously supported by various OLT implementations:

<text>{{external links|date=January 2011}}

'''10PASS-TS''' is an [[IEEE 802.3-2008]] Physical Layer ([[PHY]]) specification for a [[full-duplex]] short reach [[Point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[Ethernet]] link over [[voice-grade copper]] wiring. 2BASE-TL is used in [[Ethernet in the first mile]] applications.

10PASS-TS PHYs deliver a minimum of 10 [[Mbit/s]] over distances of up to {{convert|750|m|ft}}, using [[ITU-T]] [[G.993.1]] ([[VDSL]]) technology over a single copper pair. These PHYs may also support an optional aggregation or bonding of multiple copper pairs, called [[PME Aggregation Function]] (PAF).

Unlike [[10BASE-T]], [[100BASE-T]] and [[1000BASE-T]] PHYs, providing a single rate of 10, 100 or 1000 Mbit/s respectively, 10PASS-TS link rate can vary, depending on the copper channel characteristics, such as length, wire diameter ([[American wire gauge|gauge]]), number of pairs if the link is aggregated etc.

<title>2-XL</title>
<text>{{for|the Estonian band formerly known as 2XL|Soul Militia}}
'''2-XL''' was an educational toy in the shape of a [[robot]] that was introduced in [[1978]]. 2-XL was the  brainchild of  Dr. [[Michael J. Freeman]], who felt that toys should be both fun and educational. The toy was interactive, playing various tracks from a magnetic audio tape depending on the user's actions.

The toy was released in two different time periods. The 1978 release was produced by a toy company called [[Mego Corporation]], and used [[Stereo 8|8-track]] tapes. It was brought back in [[1992]] by [[Tiger Electronics]] in a version that used [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] rather than 8-Track.

==Mego Corporation version==
===Description===
[[Image:2-XL.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mego Corporation's 2-XL circa 1978]]
The original 2-XL (see image to right) was made of hard brown plastic, with white plastic on the front. 

The toy had two yellow light bulbs for eyes that flashed at various moments while the 8-track program tapes played, and he had four red push buttons on his stomach:
*"Question" 
*"A or Yes Or True"
*"B or More Info" 
*"C or No or False"

There was also a volume and power on knob found on the lower right portion of the unit. At the bottom was a large slot where an 8-Track tape would be inserted.

The toy was essentially a regular 8-Track player, with each button operating a different track.  It was powered by a common 9-volt AC adapter with a 3.5 mm mini-plug tip. 

===Development===
Michael J. Freeman had a hard time convincing companies of the benefits that his toy would provide. Many companies turned down the idea, saying it was just too expensive and not practical to invest so much into an educational toy when kids are typically reluctant to buy educational items. Finally, Mego Corporation decided that it fit in well with their company. They were makers of action figures based on popular TV shows, many of which were [[sci-fi]] related. 

Freeman was involved with all phases of the toy's development, including how the internal mechanism worked. The Mego version of 2-XL was produced for four years, 1978–1981.  

The mold and look got a minor change in [[1980]]:
*The eye lights became red
*The louder the volume was turned, the brighter the lights would flash
*The speaker in the back of the unit was changed from a hexagon shape to a more traditional round speaker shape. 
*The plastic was shiner and glossier looking

All told there were about 50 program tapes made for the Mego 2-XL.  It was highly popular in its first years, but it faded into obscurity after the turn of the decade. The toy will often show up on auction sites and in used toy stores. They aren't rare by any means, but aren't in mass quantities either. Some of the tapes can be harder to find; the last year tapes are rarer due to the decreased popularity of the toy in its last year on the market.

===Programs===
The 8-Track tapes focused around a robot with a [[New York]] accent, (voiced by creator Dr. Michael J. Freeman Ph.D. himself) who would speak as if the listener was right there with him wherever he happened to be in the storyline. He would ask multiple-choice questions based on the subject of the tape, and the user would answer the question he asked by pushing the corresponding button.  A right answer resulted in 2-XL congratulating the user on his knowledge, while a wrong answer would result in a razzing as 2-XL explained what the proper answer was. In between questions, there would sometimes be a story going on that the user was involved with, with the answers to the questions corresponding to the storyline. Other times 2-XL would crack a bad joke and laugh at his own humor with a crazy-sounding laugh that was one of the many running gags that would be found on almost every tape in the series.

Originally the programs were very basic. There was just one general story line.  Each track flowed through the same time length, differing only by telling the user if he was right or wrong.  Eventually, Dr. Freeman started to take advantage of the four tracks found on a tape to have up to three different programs on one tape. 

There were some general themes to each tape. The first was 2-XL's bleeping and buzzing sound effects as it turned on, as if the user was activating a huge robot (although he would often refer to its size as only a foot or so tall). He would always introduce himself in the same way, saying, "Thank you for turning me on. I am 2-XL..." . The voice did not sound robotic, and was pretty much Michael's voice only a bit slower speaking and more sophisticated sounding. There would always be a moment where the user had to push the Question button, as that went back to track one, which is where the main talking took place. There was always music or beeping sounds while the user would think, or while the new questions were loading, to make the program space out properly. Towards the end of the tape 2-XL would give the user a warning that he was getting tired and that it was time to wrap things up with one last question.  He was always very friendly and acted very human, as if he was a new buddy that wanted to help the user learn in the most enjoyable way possible.  His humor was silly as were his wisecracks, but the same themes were found throughout the various tapes, getting more and more creative as the future tapes were introduced. He would often say "Please turn me off now" and often relate the reason he had to go somehow to the topic of the tape. 

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:2-XLtapes.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Eight of Mego Corporation's 2-XL 8-Track Tapes]] -->
2-XL came with one tape, titled "General Information", which touched on various topics such as sports, movies, and pop culture. Each of the various other program tapes was sold separately and most came with a separate activity book that could be used as well while doing the activity with 2-XL. Some also came with faceplate cards that could be placed over the various buttons that had different words on them that were specifically to be used for that certain program tape. Not all of the tapes were educational, some told stories that the user would just listen to able to answer a few questions about them afterwards. Not all tapes were focused around 2-XL either. Other voices would appear on them depending on what the focus of each tape was. But somewhere 2-XL's voice would show up to keep everything in the same universe. There were also two-tape sets that would continue on with the theme of the first tape after the user finished it.

==Tiger Electronics version==
[[Image:2-xltiger.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tiger Electronic's version of 2-XL along with some program cassette tapes circa 1992]]

In 1992, Tiger Electronics re-introduced 2-XL. Instead of 8-track tapes, the new version used cassette tapes that were twice the length of the 8-tracks and had better sound quality. Freeman again provided the toy's voice. In addition to eyes that would light up, the toy now sported a circle for a mouth that could light up as he talked. The toy could now run on batteries and had a headphone jack.

Instead of the buttons simply switching tracks on the 8-track tape as in the old version, the cassette version took advantage of the fact that a cassette has a total of four tracks - one for the left and right channel on each side. The tape head in the player could play any of the four parallel tracks, based on which button was pressed. Playing a 2-XL tape in a standard tape player would result in different audio on the left and right channels, and if the reverse side was played (which was typically marked with the words "Wrong Side"), one would hear the other two tracks played in reverse.

As with the previous version, the cassette version could play any standard cassette tape, but the user needed to first push the "Question" button (or the "2/A/No" button would work as well, playing the right channel). Pressing the 3 or 4 button would play one of the channels on the reverse side of the tape backwards.

[[Image:2-XLx-men casette.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Tiger Electronic's X-Men Cassette Adventure tape for the 2-XL toy.]]
Newly released tapes were branded with comic book and cartoon characters, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]], [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]], [[X-Men]] and [[Batman]]. 2-XL games would allow the user to go on an adventure with various superheroes, deciding their fate by pushing one of the buttons.

The second version was on the market from 1992 through 1994, and about 45 tapes were released in total. The final inventory was sold in 1995 bundled with the Power Rangers tape. It was one of the most popular toys, in terms or market revenue, sold up through 1995. 

This version of 2-XL got even more exposure due to it being used on a kids TV Game Show at the time named "[[Pick Your Brain]]". A 10-foot replica of the Tiger Electronics 2-XL was used on the set to ask questions and offer extra information on the topic being talked about. Freeman was asked to do the voice of 2-XL but declined. The show was hosted by [[Marc Summers]] and 2-XL on this show was voiced by [[Greg Berg]]. This show had a high success in its first year, but was ended when the production of 2-XL ceased.

==Tri-Lex==

One of the last tapes released for the Mego Corporation version of 2XL was "Tri-Lex", a complete board game designed to be played by 2XL.  The tape came with a board which fitted over the front of the 2XL unit itself, with the board in front of the tape slot.  The game board consisted of an inverted pyramid shape, 4 squares wide at the top to 1 square at the bottom, with each row coloured in a different colour (Blue, Yellow, Green, and Tan), and 4 slots through which pieces (which 2XL called "checkers") could be dropped into the pyramid.  The slots aligned with 2XL's 4 buttons, with the intention that dropping the checker would also press the appropriate track button on 2XL.  The objective of the game was to create either a line or a triangle of 3 checkers of your own colour.  The game and tape design are interesting because they enabled the 4-track tape player to provide a passable simulation of a game-playing AI.

Several "tricks" had to be used: an additional set of "front" slots that did not interact with the buttons were provided, and 2XL occasionally told the player to "make a move in the front" so that the track would not change.  2XL would also ask the player to "remember a codeword" at certain points in the game, and to repeat it back later.  Often the game would end before the tape did, meaning that 2XL would prompt the player with "please turn my volume down to zero", after which the player would have to wait for the remainder of the current game's recording to wind through before a track-changing "click" signalled they should turn the volume back up.  (For this reason, Tri-lex was the only 2XL tape that did not say "thank you for turning me on" at the start, since the player was expected to play several games in a single session.)  Finally, although the tape appears to loop after one game, it in fact has four games recorded on it.  

The game itself is easily solved, and correctly played always ends in a win for the starting player.  The tape was thus more valuable for teaching pattern recognition than as a genuine board game.  On the tape, the player can in fact beat 2XL, but only on two of the recorded games (those where the human player goes first).  The player can defeat 2XL by using the guaranteed win, or - on occasion - by using other strategies where 2XL "makes a mistake".  2XL does not use the guaranteed win strategy against human players.  

The guaranteed win is as follows: first player plays Tan (forced, only space available), second player plays Green 1/2 (forced, only spaces available - which one does not matter, as the ensuing positions are mirror images of each other; continue following the moves on the appropriate side of the /), first player plays Green 2/1, second player plays Yellow 3/1 (forced, else first player plays it and wins with a line), first player plays Yellow 2, second player plays Blue (3 or 4)/(1 or 2), first player plays Blue (4 or 3)/(2 or 1) (forced, else second player plays it and wins with a triangle), second player plays Yellow 1/3 (forced, only space available), first player plays Blue 2/3 and wins with a line of three.

==Similar Toys==
===Kasey the Kinderbot===
Kasey the Kinderbot was a toy designed by Dr. Freeman which was targeted at kids aged 3–7.  Instead of tapes as with the previous versions, this toy used small cartridges that were not linear - the user was able to jump around to various sections at will. It was purely an educational toy with cartridges focusing on such subjects as Math, Science and languages. The cartridges were also color coded to let kids know what group of subject it belonged to. The toy was first released in 2002 by [[Fisher-Price]]. It produced a total profit of over $70 million. Spin-off characters included ''Toby the Totbot'', which focused specifically on teaching letters and numbers, and ''Fetch the Phonicsbot'' which was a dog-shaped robot holding a letter board which was aimed at the toddler age group.

<title>2-choice hashing</title>
<text>{{orphan|date=December 2008}}
'''2-choice hashing''', also known as '''2-choice chaining''', is a variant of a [[hash table]] in which keys are added by hashing with two [[hash function]]s. The key is put in the array position with the fewer (colliding) keys. Some [[collision resolution scheme]] is needed, unless keys are kept in buckets. The [[average-case cost]] of a successful search is [[Big O notation|O(2 + (m-1)/n)]], where m is the number of keys and n is the size of the array. The most collisions is <math>\log_2 \ln n + \theta(m/n)</math> with high probability.

The IBM [[System/360]], announced in 1964, was a popular computer system with 24-bit addressing and [[32-bit]] general registers and arithmetic.  The early 1980s saw the first popular personal computers, including the IBM [[PC/AT]] with an Intel [[80286]] processor using 24-bit addressing and 16-bit general registers and arithmetic, and the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh 128k]] with a Motorola [[68000]] processor featuring 24-bit addressing and 32-bit registers. The [[eZ80]] is a microprocessor and microcontroller with 24-bit registers and addressing that is binary compatible with the 8/16-bit [[Z80]].

In the [[ARM Limited|ARM]] [[ARM_architecture|processor architecture]], '''26-bit''' refers to the design used in the original ARM processors, where the [[Program Counter]] ('''PC''') and [[Status_register|Processor Status Register]] ('''PSR''') were combined into one 32-bit [[Processor_registers|register]] (R15), the status flags filling the high 6 bits and the Program Counter taking up the lower 26 bits.

In fact, because the program counter is always word-aligned the lowest two bits are always zero which allowed the designers to reuse these two bits to hold the processor's mode bits too. The four modes allowed were USR26, SVC26, IRQ26, FIQ26; contrast this with the 32 possible modes available when the program status was separated from the program counter in more recent [[ARM Architecture|ARM architectures]].

This design enabled more efficient [[Computer_program|program]] execution, as the Program Counter and status flags could be saved and restored with a single operation. This resulted in faster [[subroutine]] calls and [[interrupt]] response than traditional designs, which would have to do two register loads or saves when calling or returning from a subroutine.

==History==

Despite being [[32-bit]] internally, processors prior to the ARM6 had only a 26-bit PC and [[address bus]], and were consequently limited to 64 MB of addressable [[Random_Access_Memory|memory]]. This was still a vast amount of memory at the time, but because of this limitation, architectures since have included various steps away from the original 26-bit design.

The ARM6 introduced a 32-bit PC and separate PSR, as well as a 32-bit address bus, allowing 4 GB of memory to be addressed. The change in the PC/PSR layout caused incompatibility with code written for previous architectures, so the processor also included a 26-bit compatibility mode which used the old PC/PSR combination. The processor could still address 4 GB in this mode, but could not [[Execution_(computers)|execute]] anything above address 3FFFFFC (64 MB). This mode was used by [[RISC OS]] running on the [[Risc_PC|Acorn Risc PC]] to utilise the new processors while retaining compatibility with existing software.

More recent ARM architectures such as [[Intel]]'s [[XScale]] have dropped the 26-bit mode altogether.

'''386BSD''', sometimes called "'''Jolix'''"<ref name="foldoc">{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/jolix|title=386BSD|date=2006-06-08|work=[[Free Online Dictionary of Computing]]|accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>, was a [[Free software|free]] [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] based on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], first released in 1992. It ran on [[PC compatible]] computer systems based on the [[Intel 80386]] [[microprocessor]]. 386BSD innovations include [[role-based security]], [[ring buffer]]s, self-ordered configuration and [[Loadable kernel module|modular kernel]] design.

== History ==

386BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni [[Lynne Jolitz]] and [[William Jolitz]]. William Jolitz had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California at Berkeley (2.8 and 2.9BSD) and both contributed code to Berkeley developed at [[Symmetric Computer Systems]] during the 1980s. Work on porting 4.3BSD-Reno and later 4.3BSD Net/2 to the Intel 80386 was done for the University of California by William Jolitz at Berkeley. 4.3BSD Net/2 was an incomplete non-operational release, with portions withheld by the University of California as ''encumbered'' (i.e. subject to an [[AT and T UNIX]] [[source code]] license). The 386BSD releases made to the public beginning in 1992 were based on portions of the 4.3BSD Net/2 release coupled with additional code (see ''Missing Pieces I and II'', [[Dr. Dobb's Journal]], May–June 1992) written by William and Lynne Jolitz to make a complete operational release.

The port began in 1989 and the first, incomplete traces of the port can be found in 4.3BSD Net/2 of 1991. It was first released in March 1992 (version 0.0) and in a much more usable version on July 14, 1992 (version 0.1). The porting process with code was extensively documented in an 18-part series written by Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz in [[Dr. Dobbs Journal]] beginning in January 1991.

===FreeBSD and NetBSD===
After the release of 386BSD 0.1, a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements, releasing them as an unofficial ''[[patch (computing)|patchkit]]''. Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of 386BSD, the maintainers of the patchkit founded the [[FreeBSD]] project in 1993 to continue their work<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/history.html About the FreeBSD Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Around the same time, the [[NetBSD]] project was founded by a different group of 386BSD users, with the aim of unifying 386BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi-platform system. Both projects continue to this day.

===Lawsuit===
Due to a lawsuit ([[Unix System Laboratories|USL]] v. Regents of the University of California), some potentially so-called ''encumbered'' source was agreed to have been distributed within the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] from the University of California, and a subsequent release (1993, 4.4BSD-Lite) was made by the University to correct this issue. However, 386BSD, Dr. Dobbs Journal, and William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California, and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before, during, and after these lawsuits without limitation. There has never been any legal filings or claims from the University, USL, or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD. Finally, no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits.

==Release 1.0==
In late 1994, a finished version 386BSD Release 1.0 was distributed by Dr. Dobb's Journal on CDROM only due to the immense size (600 [[megabyte|MB]]) of the release (the ''"386BSD Reference CD-ROM"'') and was a best-selling CDROM for three years (1994–1997). 386BSD Release 1.0 contained a completely new kernel design and implementation, and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD.

==Relationship with BSD/386==
386BSD is often confused with [[BSD/386]] which was developed by [[Berkeley Software Design|BSDi]], a Berkeley spinout, starting in 1991. BSD/386 used the same 386BSD code contributed to the University of California on ''4.3BSD NET/2''. Although Jolitz worked briefly for [[UUNET]] (which later spun out BSDi) in 1991, the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in 386BSD. Instead, William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing, and returned all materials when William Jolitz left that company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and goals.

==Copyright and use of the code==
All rights with respect to 386BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz. 386BSD public releases ended in 1997 since code is now available from the many 386BSD-derived [[operating system]]s today, along with several derivatives thereof (such as [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and  [[OpenBSD]]). Portions of 386BSD may be found in other open systems such as [[OpenSolaris]]. 386BSD is available for research (non-commercial) purposes.

The '''3Com Ergo Audrey''' is a discontinued [[internet appliance]] from [[3Com]]. It was released to the public on October 17, 2000 for [[United States dollar|USD]]499 as the first (and only) device in the company's "Ergo" initiative to hit the market.<ref>{{cite web | title=3Com lets Audrey out the door | work=News.com | url= | accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> Once connected to an appropriate provider, users could access the [[internet]], send and receive [[e-mail]], play audio and video, and synchronize with up to two [[Palm OS]]-based devices.  

''Audrey'' was the brainchild of Don Fotsch (formerly of Apple Computer and U.S. Robotics) and Ray Winninger. Don and Ray had a vision for a family of appliances, each designed for a specific room in the house. The brand ''Ergo'' was meant to convey that intent, as in "it's in the kitchen, ''[[ergo]]'' it's designed that way"<ref name="ReferenceA">Direct Knowledge - I was there at the time that it was said. - Rob Hudson</ref>. There were plans to serve other rooms in the house as well. They considered the kitchen to be the heart of the home and the control room for the home manager. Don coined the phrase "Internet Snacking" to describe the lightweight web browsing done in this environment<ref name="ReferenceA"/>. 

The name ''Audrey'' was given to this first product to honor [[Audrey Hepburn]]. It was meant to deliver the elegance that she exuded. The project codename was "[[Kojak]]", named after the [[Telly Savalas]] character. The follow-on product targeted for the family room was code named "[[Mannix]]".

3Com discontinued the product on June 1, 2001, in the wake of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot.com crash]], after only seven and a half months on the market. 3Com customers received full refunds for the product and accessories.  The remaining Audrey hardware was liquidated and embraced by the [[hardware hacker]] community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Audrey's life cut short|work=News.com|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1040-254497.html|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>

==Hardware==
The Audrey is a [[touchscreen]], passive matrix LCD device and came equipped with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]].  All applications were touch-enabled.  Since the standard [[infrared]] keyboard was only needed for typing tasks, it could be hung out of the way on the rear of the unit.  The stylus was to be placed in a receptacle on the top of the screen with an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] that flashed when email arrived.  Buttons on the right side of the screen were used to access the web browser, email application, and calendar, and a wheel knob at the bottom selected different "channels" of [[push technology|push]] content.

The 3Com Audrey is powered by a 200 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[flash ROM]] and 32 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It measures 9 x 11.8 x 3.0 inches (22.86 x 29.97 x 7.62 cm), and weighs 4.1 pounds (1.86 kg). It is powered by the [[QNX]] [[operating system]].  The Audrey is equipped with a [[modem]], two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, and a [[CompactFlash]] socket.  A USB [[Ethernet]] adapter was commonly used for [[broadband]] subscribers.

The Audrey was also available in such shades as "linen" (off-white), "meadow" (green), "ocean" (blue), "slate" (grey), and "sunshine" (light yellow).

==Hacking==
After the demise of official support, the Audrey drew the attention of computer enthusiasts.  They quickly discovered an [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] to launch a [[pterm]] session.  Using [[privilege escalation]] techniques, the [[superuser|root]] password in the [[Passwd (file)|passwd]] file could be edited, opening the box to further experimentation.

Many of the tools for the [[QNX]] operating system development platform were quickly adapted for use in the Audrey, including an updated web browser ([[Voyager (web browser)|Voyager]]), an MP3 player, digital rotating photoframe, and other applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=3Com Ergo Audrey|work=PC Magazine|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,34321,00.asp|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>

The CompactFlash slot was also investigated.  Although it could not be used for storage expansion, the Audrey was set to flash its operating system from the slot.  Soon, a variety of replacement OS images were distributed among enthusiasts.  As the device could utilize an optional Ethernet connection, it was an easy task to mount a remote disk drive served up by a neighboring desktop system, thus allowing for virtually unlimited storage capability.

==Similar devices==
Devices similar to the Audrey included the [[i-Opener]] and [[Virgin Webplayer]].

<title>3D Pose Estimation</title>
<text>{{merge|Pose (computer vision)#Pose Estimation|discuss=Talk:3D Pose Estimation#Merger proposal|date=March 2010}}
'''3D pose estimation''' is the problem of determining the transformation of an object in a 2D image which gives the 3D object.  The need for 3D pose estimation arises from the limitations of feature based pose estimation.  There exist environments  where it is difficult to extract corners or edges from an image.  To circumvent these issues, the object is dealt with as a whole  through the use of free-form contours.<ref>{{cite web | author = Bodo Rosenhahn | url = http://www.ks.informatik.uni-kiel.de/modules.php/name+Publikationen | title = Pose Estimation of 3D Free-form Contours in Conformal Geometry | publisher = Institut fur Informatik und Praktische Mathematik, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat zu Kiel  | language = English / German | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}</ref>

==3D Pose Estimation from an Uncalibrated 2D Camera==
It is possible to estimate the 3D rotation and translation of a 3D object from a single 2D photo, if an approximate 3D model of the object is known and the corresponding points in the 2D image are known. A common technique for solving this has recently{{When}} been "POSIT", where the 3D pose is estimated directly from the 3D model points and the 2D image points, and corrects the errors iteratively until a good estimate is found from a single image.<ref>{{cite web | author = Dementhon and Davis, 1995 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=204015 | title = Model-based object pose in 25 lines of code | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | accessdate = 2010-05-29 }}</ref> Most implementations of POSIT only work on non-coplanar points (in other words, it wont work with flat objects or planes).<ref>{{cite web | author = Javier Barandiaran | url = http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Posit | title = POSIT tutorial with OpenCV and OpenGL | accessdate = 2010-05-29 }}</ref>

==3D Pose Estimation from a Calibrated 2D Camera==
Given a 2D image of an object, and a the camera that is calibrated with respect to a world coordinate system, it is also possible to find the pose which gives the 3D object in its object coordinate system.<ref name="Bodo Rosenhahn">{{cite web | author = Bodo Rosenhahn | url = http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/ROSENHAHN1/CVOnlinePose.html | title = Foundations about 2D-3D Pose Estimation | publisher = CV Online  | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}</ref> This works as follows.

=== Extracting 3D from 2D ===
Starting with a 2D image, image points are extracted which correspond to corners in an image.  The projection rays from the image points are reconstructed from the 2D points so that the 3D points, which must be incident with the reconstructed rays, can be determined.

===Pseudocode===
The algorithm for determining pose estimation is based on the [[Iterative Closest Point]] algorithm. The main idea is to determine the correspondences between 2D image features and points on the 3D model curve.

   (b)Estimate the nearest point of each projection ray to a point on the 3D contour<br />
   (c)Estimate the pose of the contour with the use of this correspondence set<br />
   (d)goto (b)<br />
</code>

The above algorithm does not account for images containing an object that is partially occluded.  The following algorithm assumes that all contours are rigidly coupled, meaning the pose of one contour defines the pose of another contour.

<code>
   (a)Reconstruct projection rays from the image points<br />
   (b)For each projection ray R:<br />
        (c)For each 3D contour:<br />
             (c1)Estimate the nearest point P1 of ray R to a point on the contour<br />
             (c2)if (n==1) chose P1 as actual P for the point-line correspondence<br />
             (c3)else compare P1 with P:<br />
                      if dist(P1, R) is smaller than dist(P, R)<br />
                           then choose P1 as new P<br />
   (d)Use (P, R) as correspondence set.<br />
   (e)Estimate pose with this correspondence set<br />
   (f)Transform contours, goto (b)<br />
</code>

In practice, using a 2 GHz Intel [[Pentium]] processor, average speeds of 29fps have been reached using the above algorithm.<ref name="Bodo Rosenhahn"/>

== Estimating Pose Through Comparison ==
Systems exist which use a database of an object at different rotations and translations to compare an input image against to estimate pose.  These systems accuracy is limited to situations which are represented in their database of images, however the goal is to recognize a pose, rather than determine it.<ref>{{cite web | author = Vassilis Athitsos | url =  | title = Estimating 3D Hand Pose from a Cluttered Image | publisher = Boston University Computer Science Tech. | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}</ref>

'''3D computer graphics software''' refers to programs used to create [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer-generated imagery]]. This article covers only some of the software used.

==Uses==
3D modelers are used in a wide variety of industries.  The medical industry uses them to create detailed models of organs.  The movie industry uses them to create and manipulate characters and objects for animated and real-life [[film|motion pictures]].  The [[video game industry]] uses them to create assets for [[video game]]s. The science sector uses them to create highly detailed models of chemical compounds.  The architecture industry uses them to create models of proposed buildings and landscapes.  The engineering community uses them to design new devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses. There are typically many stages in the "[[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]" that studios and manufacturers use to create 3D objects for film, games, and production of hard goods and structures.

==Features==
Many 3D modelers are designed to model various real-world entities, from [[plant]]s to [[automobile]]s to [[human|people]].  Some are specially designed to model certain objects, such as chemical compounds or internal [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.

3D modelers allow users to create and alter models via their 3D mesh.  Users can add, subtract, stretch and otherwise change the mesh to their desire.  Models can be viewed from a variety of angles, usually simultaneously.  Models can be rotated and the view can be zoomed in and out.

3D modelers can export their models to [[computer file|files]], which can then be imported into other applications as long as the [[metadata]] is compatible.  Many modelers allow [[importer (computing)|importers]] and [[exporter (computing)|exporters]] to be [[plugin|plugged-in]], so they can read and write data in the native formats of other applications.

Most 3D modelers contain a number of related features, such as [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracers]] and other rendering alternatives and [[texture mapping]] facilities.  Some also contain features that support or allow animation of models.  Some may be able to generate [[full-motion video]] of a series of rendered scenes (i.e. [[animation]]).

==Commercial packages==

<title>3D single object recognition</title>
<text>{{FeatureDetectionCompVisNavbox}}

In [[computer vision]], '''3D single [[object recognition]]''' involves recognizing and determining the pose of user-chosen [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] object in a [[photograph]] or [[range scan]].  Typically, an example of the object to be recognized is presented to a vision system in a controlled environment, and then for an arbitrary input such as a [[video stream]], the system locates the previously presented object.  This can be done either [[off-line]], or in [[real-time]].  The [[algorithms]] for solving this problem are specialized for locating a single pre-identified object, and can be contrasted with algorithms which operate on general [[class (computer science)|classes]] of objects, such as [[Facial recognition system|face recognition systems]] or [[3D generic object recognition]].  Due to the low cost and ease of acquiring photographs, a significant amount of research has been devoted to 3D object recognition in photographs.

== 3D single object recognition in photographs ==

The method of recognizing a 3D object depends on the properties of an object.  For simplicity, many existing algorithms have focused on recognizing [[Stiffness|rigid]] objects consisting of a single part, that is, objects whose spatial transformation is a [[Euclidean motion]].  Two general approaches have been taken to the problem: [[pattern recognition]] approaches use low-level image appearance information to locate an object, while feature-based geometric approaches construct a model for the object to be recognized, and match the model against the photograph.  

=== Pattern recognition approaches ===

These methods use appearance information gathered from pre-captured or pre-computed projections of an object to match the object in the potentially cluttered scene.  However, they do not take the 3D geometric constraints of the object into consideration during matching, and typically also do not handle occlusion as well as feature-based approaches.  See [Murase and Nayar 1995] and [Selinger and Nelson 1999].

=== Feature-based geometric approaches ===

[[Image:Feature example.png|right|thumb|322px|An example of a detected feature in an image.  Blue indicates the center of the feature, the red ellipse indicates the characteristic scale identified by the feature detector, and the green parallelogram is constructed from the coordinates of the ellipse as per [Lowe 2004].]]

Feature-based approaches work well for objects which have distinctive [[Feature (Computer vision)|features]].  Thus far, objects which have good [[edge feature]]s or [[Blob detection|blob]] features have been successfully recognized; for example detection algorithms, see [[Harris affine region detector]] and [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]], respectively.  Due to lack of the appropriate feature detectors, objects without textured, smooth surfaces cannot currently be handled by this approach.

Feature-based object recognizers generally work by pre-capturing a number of fixed views of the object to be recognized, extracting features from these views, and then in the recognition process, matching these features to the scene and enforcing geometric constraints.

As an example of a prototypical system taking this approach, we will present an outline of the method used by [Rothganger et al. 2004], with some detail elided.  The method starts by assuming that objects undergo globally rigid transformations.  Because smooth surfaces are locally planar, [[affine invariant]] features are appropriate for matching: the paper [[feature detector|detects]] ellipse-shaped regions of interest using both edge-like and blob-like features, and as per [Lowe 2004], finds the dominant gradient direction of the ellipse, converts the ellipse into a parallelogram, and takes a [[SIFT]] descriptor on the resulting parallelogram.  Color information is used also to improve discrimination over SIFT features alone.

[[Image:Partial features 3d.png|right|thumb|322px|Partial models of features, projected into 3D, constructed from nearby views of a teddy-bear.  Taken from [Rothganger et al. 2004].]]

Next, given a number of camera views of the object (24 in the paper), the method constructs a 3D model for the object, containing the 3D spatial position and orientation of each feature.  Because the number of views of the object is large, typically each feature is present in several adjacent views.  The center points of such matching features correspond, and detected features are aligned along the dominant gradient direction, so the points at (1, 0) in the local coordinate system of the feature parallelogram also correspond, as do the points (0, 1) in the parallelogram's local coordinates.  Thus for every pair of matching features in nearby views, three point pair correspondences are known.  Given at least two matching features, a multi-view affine [[structure from motion]] algorithm (see [Tomasi and Kanade 1992]) can be used to construct an estimate of points positions (up to an arbitrary affine transformation).  The paper of Rothganger et al. therefore selects two adjacent views, uses a [[RANSAC]]-like method to select two corresponding pairs of features, and adds new features to the partial model built by RANSAC so long as they are under an error term.  Thus for any given pair of adjacent views, the algorithm creates a partial model of all features visible in both views.

[[Image:Features full 3d.png|right|thumb|322px|Final merged model of features for the teddy bear, after Euclidean upgrade.  For recognition, this model is matched against a photograph of the scene using RANSAC.  Taken from [Rothganger et al. 2004].]]

To produce a unified model, the paper takes the largest partial model, and incrementally aligns all smaller partial models to it.  Global minimization is used to reduce the error, then a [[Euclidean upgrade]] is used to change the model's feature positions from 3D coordinates unique up to affine transformation to 3D coordinates that are unique up to [[Euclidean motion]].  At the end of this step, one has a model of the target object, consisting of features projected into a common 3D space.

To recognize an object in an arbitrary input image, the paper detects features, and then uses [[RANSAC]] to find the [[affine projection]] matrix which best fits the unified object model to the 2D scene.  If this RANSAC approach has sufficiently low error, then on success, the algorithm both recognizes the object and gives the object's pose in terms of an affine projection.  Under the assumed conditions, the method typically achieves recognition rates of around 95%.

The [[Intel 4004]], the world's first commercially available single-[[integrated circuit|chip]] [[microprocessor]], was a 4-bit [[central processing unit|CPU]].  The [[F-14 Tomcat]]'s [[Central Air Data Computer]] (or '''F14 CADC)''' was created a year before the 4004, but its existence was [[Classified information|classified]] by the [[United States Navy]] until 1997.  Also, the [[HP-48 series|HP48]] [[HP Saturn (microprocessor)|Saturn processor]] (a commonly used scientific calculator) is basically a 4-bit machine, though it strings multiple words together, e.g. its 20-bit memory addressing.

The [[1970s]] saw the emergence of 4-bit software applications for mass markets like pocket calculators.

With 4 bits, it is possible to create 16 different values. All single digit hexadecimal numbers can be written with 4 bits.

<title>4CAPS</title>
<text>'''4CAPS''' (Cortical Capacity-Constrained Concurrent Activation-based Production System) is a [[cognitive architecture]] developed by [[Marcel Just|Marcel A. Just]] and Sashank Varma at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] <ref name="jv2006">Just, M. A., &amp; Varma, S. (2007). The organization of thinking: What functional brain imaging reveals about the neuroarchitecture of complex cognition. ''Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Neuroscience'', ''7(3)'', 153-191.</ref>.

''Psychological Review'', ''109'', 55-65.</ref> cognitive architectures.

==Overview and Assumptions==
In 4CAPS computations are distributed and dynamically balanced among independent processing centers.  Like in other cognitive architectures (e.g., [[ACT-R]]), these processing centers have been identified with corresponding cortical regions in the human brain.  Performing  specific task, such as reading or driving, requires the simultaneous contribution of many of such regions.

Notably, 4CAPS differs from other architectures for its stress on the capacity constraints (that is, limited computational power), and the dynamic collaboration between different centers.  In particular, according the Just and Varma <ref name="jv2006"/>, 4CAPS is based on four characteristic assumptions:

# Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions
# Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources
# The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated.
# Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels.

==Implementation and Applications==
Like other cognitive architectures (such as [[ACT-R]], [[EPIC (cognitive architecture)|EPIC]], and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]]), 4CAPS is implemented as a [[production system]]<ref name="jv2006"/>. It is written in the [[Common Lisp]] programming language<ref>The source code for 4CAPS can be found at http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu/4CAPS/index.html</ref>.  This system has been used to create computational models for a variety of phenomena, especially in the field of cognitive neuroscience.  In particular, 4CAPS models have been created and used to fit behavioral and imaging data for tasks such as the Tower of London<ref>Newman, S. D., Carpenter, P. A., Varma, S., &amp; Just, M. A. (2003). Frontal and parietal participation in problem solving in the Tower of London: fMRI and computational modeling of planning and high-level perception.

<title>64-bit</title>
<text>{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
{{N-bit|64|(8 [[octet (computing)|octets]])}}

'''64-bit''' CPUs have existed in [[supercomputers]] since the 1970s ([[Cray-1]], 1975; [[CDC 6000 series]], 1964, were 60-bit) and in [[RISC]]-based [[computer workstation|workstations]] and [[Server (computing)|server]]s since the early 1990s. In 2003 they were introduced to the (previously [[32-bit]]) mainstream [[personal computer]] arena, in the form of the [[x86-64]] and 64-bit [[PowerPC]] processor architectures.

Without further qualification, a ''64-bit'' computer architecture generally has integer and addressing [[processor register|registers]] that are 64 bits wide, allowing direct support for 64-bit data types and addresses. However, a CPU might have external [[data bus]]es or [[address bus]]es with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] had a 64-bit data bus, for instance). The term may also refer to the size of low-level data types, such as 64-bit [[Floating point|floating-point]] numbers.

==Architectural implications==
Processor registers are typically divided into several groups: ''integer'', ''floating-point'', ''[[SIMD]]'', ''control'', and often special registers for address arithmetic which may have various uses and names such as ''address'', ''index'' or ''base registers''. However, in modern designs, these functions are often performed by more general purpose ''integer'' registers. In most processors, only integer and/or address-registers can be used to address data in memory, the other types cannot. The size of these registers therefore normally limits the amount of directly addressable memory, even if there are registers, such as floating-point registers, that are wider.

Most high performance 32-bit and 64-bit processors (some notable exceptions are most [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and 32-bit [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] CPUs) have integrated floating point hardware, which is often, but not always, based on 64-bit units of data. For example, although the [[x86]]/[[x87]] architecture has instructions capable of loading and storing 64-bit (and 32-bit) floating-point values in memory, the internal data and register format is 80 bits wide. In contrast, the 64-bit [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] family uses a 64-bit floating-point data and register format (as well as 64-bit integer registers).

==History==
Most CPUs are designed so that the contents of a single integer register can store the [[memory address|address]] (location) of any datum in the computer's [[virtual memory]]. Therefore, the total number of addresses in the virtual memory &amp;mdash; the total amount of data the computer can keep in its working area &amp;mdash; is determined by the width of these registers. Beginning in the 1960s with the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] (which was an exception, in that it used the low order 24 bits of a word for addresses, resulting in a 16 [[megabyte|MB]] [{{nowrap|16 × 1024<sup>2</sup> bytes}}] address space size), then (amongst many others) the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]] minicomputer in the 1970s, and then with the [[Intel 80386]] in the mid-1980s, a ''de facto'' consensus developed that 32 bits was a convenient register size.  A 32-bit [[address register]] meant that 2<sup>32</sup> addresses, or 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], could be referenced. At the time these architectures were devised, 4 GB of memory was so far beyond the typical quantities (4 MB) in installations that this was considered to be enough "headroom" for addressing. 4.29 billion addresses were considered an appropriate size to work with for another important reason: 4.29 billion integers are enough to assign unique references to most entities in applications like [[database]]s.

Some [[supercomputer]] architectures of the 1970s and 1980s used registers up to 64 bits wide. In the mid-1980s, Intel i860<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/38.31467 |title=The Intel i860 64-Bit Processor: A General-Purpose CPU with 3D Graphics Capabilities |date=July/August 1989 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=85–94|first=Jack |last=Grimes |first2=Les |last2=Kohn |first3=Rajeev |last3=Bharadhwaj|work=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> development began culminating in a (too late<ref>Zachary, ''Showstopper!''</ref> for Windows NT) 1989 release.  However, 32 bits remained the norm until the early 1990s, when the continual reductions in the cost of memory led to installations with quantities of RAM approaching 4 GB, and the use of virtual memory spaces exceeding the 4 GB ceiling became desirable for handling certain types of problems. In response, MIPS and DEC developed 64-bit microprocessor architectures, initially for high-end [[workstation]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] machines. By the mid-1990s, [[HAL Computer Systems]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Hewlett Packard]] had developed 64-bit architectures for their workstation and server systems. A notable exception to this trend were [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] from IBM, which then used 32-bit data and 31-bit address sizes; the IBM mainframes did not include 64-bit processors until 2000. During the 1990s, several low-cost 64-bit microprocessors were used in consumer electronics and embedded applications. Notably, the [[Nintendo 64]]<ref>{{cite press release|title=NEC Offers Two High Cost Performance 64-bit RISC Microprocessors|publisher=[[NEC]]|date=1998-01-20|url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9801/2002.htm|accessdate=2011-01-09|quote=Versions of the VR4300 processor are widely used in consumer and office automation applications, including the popular Nintendo 64TM video game and advanced laser printers such as the recently announced, award-winning Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4000 printer family.}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 2]] had 64-bit microprocessors before their introduction in personal computers. High-end printers and network equipment, as well as industrial computers also used 64-bit microprocessors such as the [[Quantum Effect Devices]] [[R5000]]. 64-bit computing started to drift down to the personal computer desktop from 2003 onwards, when some models in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s Macintosh lines switched to [[PowerPC 970]] processors (termed "G5" by Apple) and the launch of [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s 64-bit [[x86-64]] extension to the [[x86]] architecture, itself a response to [[Intel]]'s [[Itanium]] gaining early [[operating system]]s support.

==Limitations==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}

Most 64-bit microprocessors on the market today have an artificial limit on the amount of memory they can address, considerably lower than what might be expected from 64 bits. For example, the [[x86-64|AMD64 architecture]] currently has a 52 bit limit on physical memory and only supports a 48-bit virtual address space.<ref>AMD64 Programmer's Manual Volume 2: System Programming, order number 24593, revision 3.14, September 2007, Advanced Micro Devices</ref> This is 4 [[petabyte|PB]] ({{nowrap|4 × 1024<sup>5</sup> bytes}}) and 256 [[terabyte|TB]] ({{nowrap|256 × 1024<sup>4</sup> bytes}}), respectively. A PC cannot contain 4 petabytes of memory (due to the size of current memory chips if nothing else) but AMD envisioned large servers, shared memory clusters, and other uses of physical address space that might approach this in the foreseeable future, and the 52 bit physical address provides ample room for expansion while not incurring the cost of implementing 64-bit physical addresses. Similarly, the 48-bit virtual address space was designed to provide more than 65,000 times the 32 bit limit of 4 [[gigabyte|GB]] ({{nowrap|4 × 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes}}), allowing ample room for expansion in the near future without incurring the overhead of translating full 64-bit addresses.

==32- vs 64-bit==
A change from a [[32-bit]] to a 64-bit architecture is a fundamental alteration, as most [[operating system]]s must be extensively modified to take advantage of the new architecture.{{Why?|date=November 2010}} Other software must also be [[porting|ported]] to use the new capabilities; older software is usually supported through either a ''hardware compatibility mode'' (in which the new processors support the older 32-bit version of the instruction set as well as the 64-bit version), through software [[Emulator|emulation]], or by the actual implementation of a 32-bit processor core within the 64-bit processor (as with the Itanium processors from Intel, which include an [[x86]] processor core to run 32-bit x86 applications). The operating systems for those 64-bit architectures generally support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.<ref>{{cite web

One significant exception to this is the [[AS/400]], whose software runs on a virtual [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]], called TIMI (Technology Independent Machine Interface) which is translated to native machine code by low-level software before being executed. The low-level software is all that has to be rewritten to move the entire OS and all software to a new platform, such as when IBM transitioned their line from the older 32/48-bit "IMPI" instruction set to 64-bit PowerPC (IMPI wasn't anything like 32-bit PowerPC, so this was an even bigger transition than from a 32-bit version of an instruction set to a 64-bit version of the same instruction set).

While 64-bit architectures indisputably make working with large data sets in applications such as [[digital video]], scientific computing, and large [[database]]s easier, there has been considerable debate as to whether they or their 32-bit compatibility modes will be faster than comparably-priced 32-bit systems for other tasks. In [[x86-64]] architecture (AMD64), the majority of the 32-bit operating systems and applications are able to run smoothly on the 64-bit hardware.

A compiled Java program can run on a 32 bit or 64 bit Java virtual machine without modification. The lengths and precision of all the built in types are specified by the standard and are not dependent on the underlying architecture. Java programs that run on a 64 bit Java virtual machine have access to a larger address space.<ref>{{cite web

Speed is not the only factor to consider in a comparison of 32-bit and 64-bit processors. Applications such as multi-tasking, stress testing, and clustering—for HPC ([[high-performance computing]])—may be more suited to a 64-bit architecture when deployed appropriately. 64-bit clusters have been widely deployed in large organizations such as IBM, HP and Microsoft, for this reason.

==Pros and cons==
A common{{fact|date=January 2011}} misconception is that 64-bit architectures are no better than 32-bit architectures unless the computer has more than 4 GB of [[main memory]]. This is not entirely true:

*Some operating systems and certain hardware configurations limit the physical memory space to 3 GB on [[IA-32]] systems, due to much of the 3–4 GB region being reserved for hardware addressing; see [[3 GB barrier]]. This is not present in 64-bit architectures, which can use 4 GB of memory and more. However, IA-32 processors from the [[Pentium II]] onwards allow for a 36-bit ''physical'' memory address space, using [[Physical Address Extension]] (PAE), which gives a 64 GB physical address range, of which up to 62 GB may be used by main memory; operating systems that support PAE may not be limited to 4GB of physical memory, even on IA-32 processors.

*Some operating systems reserve portions of [[Process (computing)|process]] [[address space]] for OS use, effectively reducing the total address space available for mapping memory for user programs. For instance, Windows XP DLLs and other user mode OS components are mapped into each process's address space, leaving only 2 to 3 GB (depending on the settings) address space available. This limit is currently much higher on 64-bit operating systems and does not realistically restrict memory usage.

*[[Memory-mapped file]]s are becoming more difficult to implement in 32-bit architectures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A 4 GB file is no longer uncommon, and such large files cannot be memory mapped easily to 32-bit architectures; only a region of the file can be mapped into the address space, and to access such a file by memory mapping, those regions will have to be mapped into and out of the address space as needed. This is a problem, as memory mapping remains one of the most efficient disk-to-memory methods, when properly implemented by the OS.

*Some programs such as data encryption software can benefit greatly from 64-bit registers (if the software is 64-bit compiled) and effectively execute 3 to 5 times faster on 64-bit than on 32-bit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

*Some 64-bit architectures, such as [[x86-64]], allow for more general purpose registers than their 32-bit counterparts. This is a significant speed increase for tight loops since the processor doesn't have to go out the second level cache or main memory to gather data if it can fit in the available registers.
:Example in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
<source lang="c">
for (a=0; a&amp;lt;100; a++)
{
  b = a;
  c = b;
  d = c;
  e = d;
}
</source>
:If a processor only has the ability to keep two three values/variables (registers) in fast memory it would need to stop executing and push and pop the stack to be able to process variable d and e as well. A process that takes a lot of CPU cycles. A processor that is capable of holding all the values/variables (registers) in memory can simply just loop through this without needing to halt execution for each iteration just to get the proper data in memory. This behavior can easily be compared with virtual memory, although any effects are contingent upon the compiler.

The main disadvantage of 64-bit architectures is that relative to 32-bit architectures, the same data occupies more space in memory (due to swollen pointers and possibly other types and alignment padding). This increases the memory requirements of a given process and can have implications for efficient processor cache utilization. Maintaining a partial 32-bit model is one way to handle this and is in general reasonably effective. For example, the [[z/OS]] operating system takes this approach currently, requiring program code to reside in 31-bit address spaces (the high order bit is not used in address calculation on the underlying hardware platform) while data objects can optionally reside in 64-bit regions.

Currently, most proprietary [[x86]] software is compiled into 32-bit code, with less being also compiled into 64-bit code (although the trend is rapidly equalizing {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}), so much does not take advantage of the larger 64-bit address space or wider 64-bit registers and data paths on x86 processors, or the additional registers in 64-bit mode. However, users of most RISC platforms, and users of [[free software|free]] or [[open source]] operating systems (where the [[source code]] is available for recompiling with a 64-bit compiler) have been able to use exclusive 64-bit computing environments for years due to the likelihood of the existence of someone willing to compile the code thusly. Not all such applications require a large address space nor manipulate 64-bit data items, so they wouldn't benefit from the larger address space or wider registers and data paths. The main advantage to 64-bit versions of such applications is the ability to access more registers in the [[x86-64]] architecture.

=== Software availability ===
x86-based 64-bit systems sometimes lack equivalents to [[software]] that is written for 32-bit architectures. The most severe problem in Microsoft Windows is incompatible [[device driver]]s. Most 32-bit application software can run on a 64-bit operating system in a compatibility mode, also known as an [[Emulator|emulation]] mode, e.g. Microsoft [[WoW64]] Technology for IA-64 and AMD64. The 64-bit Windows Native Mode<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897447.aspx |title=Inside Native Applications |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> driver environment runs atop 64-bit NTDLL.DLL which cannot call 32-bit Win32 subsystem code (often devices whose actual hardware function is emulated in user mode software, like Winprinters). Because 64-bit drivers for most devices were not available until early 2007 (Vista x64), using 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating system was considered a challenge. However, the trend is changing towards 64-bit computing as most manufacturers provide both 32-bit and 64-bit drivers nowadays, so this issue is most likely to occur when attempting to use older peripherals.

This is less of a problem with open source drivers that are already available for a 32-bit OS, since they can be modified to be 64-bit compatible, if necessary. Furthermore, support for hardware made before early 2007 was equally troubling for opensource platforms due to their small market shares in desktop market.

On most Macs, [[Mac OS X]] runs with a 32-bit kernel even on 64-bit-capable processors, but the 32-bit kernel can run 64-bit user-mode code; this allows those Macs to support 64-bit processes while still supporting 32-bit device drivers - although not 64-bit drivers and performance advantages that would come with them.  On systems with 64-bit processors, both the 32-bit and 64-bit Mac OS X kernel can run 32-bit user-mode code, and all versions of Mac OS X include 32-bit versions of libraries that 32-bit applications would use, so 32-bit user-mode software for Mac OS X will run on those systems.

[[Linux]] and most other [[Unix-like]] operating systems, and the [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] toolchains for them, have supported 64-bit processors for many years: releasing 64-bit versions of their operating system before official Microsoft releases.  Many applications and libraries for those platforms are [[open source]], written in C and C++, so that, if it's 64-bit-safe, they can be compiled into 64-bit versions.  This source bade distribution model with an emphasis on frequent releases and cutting edge code makes availability of application software for those operating systems less of an issue.

==64-bit data models==
{{inappropriate tone|section|date=December 2010}}
Converting application software written in a [[high-level language]] from a 32-bit architecture to a 64-bit architecture varies in difficulty.
One common recurring problem is that some programmers assume that [[Pointer (computing)|pointers]] have the same length as some other data type. These programmers assume they can transfer quantities between these data types without losing information.
Those assumptions happen to be true on some 32-bit machines (and even some 16-bit machines), but they are no longer true on 64-bit machines.
This common mistake is often called "the heresy that 'all the world's a VAX.'".<ref>
[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-openpower1/#N100C7 "Exploring 64-bit development on POWER5: How portable is your code, really?"]

The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and its descendant [[C++]] make it particularly easy to make this sort of mistake.  Differences between the [[C90 (C version)|C89]] and [[C (programming language)#C99|C99]] language standards also exacerbate the problem.<ref>{{cite web|firat=Eric |last=Sosman |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c/msg/82fdb7c12af4e6ba |title=Comp.lang.c: C89, size_t, and long |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref>

To avoid this mistake in C and C++, the <code>sizeof</code> operator can be used to determine the size of these primitive types if decisions based on their size need to be made, both at compile- and run-time. Also, the &amp;lt;[[limits.h]]&amp;gt; header in the [[C (programming language)#C99|C99]] standard, and numeric_limits class in &amp;lt;limits&amp;gt; header in the C++ standard, give more helpful info; sizeof only returns the size in ''[[Character (computing)|chars]]''. This used to be misleading, because the standards leave the definition of the <code>CHAR_BIT</code> macro, and therefore the number of bits in a ''char'', to the implementations. However, except for those compilers targeting [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]]s, "64 bits == 8 chars of 8 bits each" has become the norm.

One needs to be careful to use the <code>ptrdiff_t</code> type (in the standard header <code>&amp;lt;stddef.h&amp;gt;</code>) for the result of subtracting two pointers; too much code incorrectly uses "int" or "long" instead. To represent a pointer (rather than a pointer difference) as an integer, use <code>uintptr_t</code> where available (it is only defined in C99, but some compilers otherwise conforming to an earlier version of the standard offer it as an extension).

Neither C nor C++ define the length of a pointer, int, or long to be a specific number of bits. In C99, however, [[stdint.h]] provides names for integer types with certain numbers of bits where those types are available.

===Specific C-language data models===
In most programming environments on 32-bit machines, pointers, "int" (that is, integer) types, and "long" (that is, long integer) types are all 32 bits wide.

However, in many programming environments on 64-bit machines, "int" variables are still 32 bits wide, but long integers and pointers are 64 bits wide. These are described as having an '''LP64''' [[data model]]. Another alternative is the '''ILP64''' data model in which all three data types are 64 bits wide, and even '''SILP64''' where "short" integers are also 64 bits wide{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. However, in most cases the modifications required are relatively minor and straightforward, and many well-written programs can simply be recompiled for the new environment without changes. Another alternative is the '''LLP64''' model, which maintains compatibility with 32-bit code by leaving both int and long as 32-bit. "LL" refers to the "long long integer" type, which is at least 64 bits on all platforms, including 32-bit environments.

Many 64-bit compilers today use the '''LP64''' model (including Solaris, [[AIX]], [[HP-UX]], Linux, [[Mac OS X]], [[FreeBSD]], and IBM [[z/OS]] native compilers). Microsoft's [[Visual C++]] compiler uses the '''LLP64''' model. The disadvantage of the LP64 model is that storing a long into an int may overflow. On the other hand, casting a pointer to a long will work. In the LLP model, the reverse is true. These are not problems which affect fully standard-compliant code but code is often written with implicit assumptions about the widths of integer types.

Note that a programming model is a choice made on a per-compiler basis, and several can coexist on the same OS. However, the programming model chosen as the primary model for the OS API typically dominates.

Another consideration is the data model used for [[Device driver|driver]]s. Drivers make up the majority of the operating system code in most modern operating systems (although many may not be loaded when the operating system is running). Many drivers use pointers heavily to manipulate data, and in some cases have to load pointers of a certain size into the hardware they support for [[Direct memory access|DMA]]. As an example, a driver for a 32-bit PCI device asking the device to DMA data into upper areas of a 64-bit machine's memory could not satisfy requests from the operating system to load data from the device to memory above the 4 gigabyte barrier, because the pointers for those addresses would not fit into the DMA registers of the device. This problem is solved by having the OS take the memory restrictions of the device into account when generating requests to drivers for DMA, or by using an [[IOMMU]].

==Current 64-bit microprocessor architectures==
64-bit [[processor architecture|microprocessor architectures]] ({{As of|2010|lc=on}}) include:
* The 64-bit extension created by [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] to Intel's [[x86]] architecture (later licensed by Intel); commonly known as "[[x86-64]]", "AMD64", or "x64":
** AMD's [[AMD64]] extensions (used in [[Athlon 64]], [[Opteron]], [[Sempron]], [[Turion 64]], [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]], [[Athlon II]] and [[Phenom II]] processors)
** [[Intel]]'s [[Intel 64]] extensions (used in newer [[Celeron]], [[Pentium 4]], [[Pentium D]], [[Xeon]], [[Core 2]], [[Intel Core i3|Core i3]], [[Intel Core i5|Core i5]], [[Intel Core i7|Core i7]], and [[Intel Atom|Atom]] processors)

'''6in4''' is an Internet [[IPv6#Transition mechanisms|transition mechanism]] for migrating from [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) to [[IPv6]]. 6in4 uses [[Tunneling protocol|tunneling]] to encapsulate IPv6 traffic over explicitly-configured IPv4 links as defined in RFC 4213 (obsoletes RFC 2893 and RFC 1933). The 6in4 traffic is sent over the IPv4 Internet inside IPv4 packets whose IP headers have the [[IP protocol number]] set to 41. This protocol number is specifically designated for ''IPv6 encapsulation''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xml |title=Protocol Numbers}}</ref> In 6in4, the IPv4 packet header is immediately followed by the IPv6 packet being carried. This means that the encapsulation overhead is simply the size of the IPv4 header of 20 bytes. With an Ethernet [[Maximum Transmission Unit]] (MTU) of 1500 bytes, one can thus send IPv6 packets of 1480 bytes without fragmentation. 6in4 tunneling is also referred to as ''proto-41 static'' because the endpoints are configured statically. Although 6in4 tunnels are generally manually configured, for example the utility [[AICCU]] can configure tunnel parameters automatically after retrieving information from a [[Tunnel Information and Control Protocol]] (TIC) server. 

There are similarly named methods, namely [[6to4]] or [[6over4]], which describe a different mechanism. The method [[6to4]] makes use of proto-41 too, but instead of static configuration of the endpoints, the endpoint IPv4 address information is derived from the IPv6 addresses within the IPv6 packet header.

==Network address translators (NAT)==
When an endpoint of a 6in4 tunnel is behind a [[Network Address Translation|NAT]], one can in some cases still make use of the [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]] feature of a NAT router. The NAT router will then forward all incoming proto-41 packets to the configured host, thus making the tunnel work. Some NAT devices even allow transparent operation of 6in4.

==Dynamic 6in4 tunnels and heartbeat==
Even though 6in4 tunnels are static in nature, with the help of for example the heartbeat protocol<ref>[http://www.sixxs.net/tools/heartbeat/ Heartbeat Protocol], J. Massar and P. van Pelt</ref> one can still have dynamic tunnel endpoints. The heartbeat protocol signals the other side of the tunnel with its current endpoint location. A tool such as [[AICCU]] can then update the endpoints, in effect making the endpoint dynamic while still using the 6in4 protocol. These kind of tunnels are generally called 'proto-41 heartbeat' tunnels.

==Security issues==
The 6in4 protocol has no security features, thus one can easily inject IPv6 packets by [[IP_address_spoofing|spoofing]] the source IPv4 address of a tunnel endpoint and sending it to the other endpoint. This problem can partially be solved by implementing [[network ingress filtering]] or with [[IPsec]]. Another solution is to use a secure protocol such as [[AYIYA]] or other tunneling methods that compute digital signatures for each packet thus facilitating verification of packet authenticity.

The mentioned packet injection loophole of 6in4 was exploited for a research benefit in a method called ''IPv6 Tunnel Discovery'' <ref name="tundisco">[http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~compunet/tunneldiscovery IPv6 Tunnel Discovery], L. Colitti, G. Di Battista, and M. Patrignani</ref> which allowed the researchers to discover operating IPv6 tunnels around the world.

Eight-bit CPUs normally use an [[octet (computing)|8-bit]] [[data bus]] and a [[16-bit]] address bus which means that their [[address space]] is limited to 64 [[kibibyte|KiB]].  This is not a "natural law", however, so there are exceptions.

The first widely adopted 8-bit [[microprocessor]] was the [[Intel 8080]], being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]].  The [[Zilog Z80]] (compatible with the 8080) and the [[Motorola 6800]] were also used in similar computers.  The Z80 and the [[MOS Technology 6502]] 8-bit CPUs were widely used in [[home computer]]s and [[game console]]s of the '70s and '80s.  Many 8-bit CPUs or [[microcontroller]]s are the basis of today's ubiquitous [[embedded systems]].  

There are 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible values for 8 bits.

The first microprocessors had a [[4-bit]] word length and were developed around 1970. The first commercial microprocessor was the [[Binary coded decimal|BCD-based]] [[Intel 4004]] (1971), developed for calculator applications. The first commercial 8-bit processor was the [[Intel 8008]] (1972) which was originally intended for [[intelligent terminal]]s. Most competitors to Intel started off with such character oriented 8-bit microprocessors. Modernized variants of these 8-bit machines are still one of the most common types of processor in embedded systems.

==List of 8-bit CPUs==
A [[CPU]] can be classified on the basis of the [[data]] it can access in a single [[Instruction (computer science)|operation]]. An 8-bit processor can access 8 bits of data in a single operation, as opposed to a [[16-bit]] processor, which can access 16 bits of data in a single operation.

<title>8A4 class ROUV</title>
<text>{{Technical|date=September 2009}}
The '''8A4 class ROUV''' is a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROUV), a Chinese ROUV used to perform various underwater tasks ranging from oil platform service to salvage and rescue missions. The 8A4 is a member of a series of related ROUVs developed in the [[People's Republic of China]], with improved versions designed using earlier versions or commercially available versions as a starting point. The predecessor to the 8A4 is the RECON-IV, which is an improved version of the American RECON-III. The 8A4 is an improved version of the American AMETEK 2006. The 7B8 is an improved version of the 8A4.<ref>[http://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node2245/node76988/node76993/node77007/node77103/userobject1ai96372.html 8A4 ROUV (in Chinese)]</ref>

==RECON-IV ROUV==
The origin of 8A4 traces back to the RECON-IV ROUV.  Since the 1980s, China begun to operate ROUVs to support its offshore oil drill operations and salvage operations, such as Hysub 10 ROUVs and Hysub 40 ROUVs supplied by the Canadian firm International Submarine Engineering in [[British Columbia]].  Hysub 40 ROUVs was deployed by [[Shanghai]] Salvage Bureau and proved its worth not only in oil drilling operations, but also in salvage and rescue missions.  However, these foreign built ROUVs were simply too expensive to be adopted in significant numbers, and the salvage operational needs of the [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN) could not be met.  As a result, China decided to develop its own version of ROUVs with similar capability.

One of the first ROUVs domestically built in China was the RECON-IV ROUV, which is based on the American RECON-III ROUV built by Perry Oceanographic (later purchased by [[Lockheed Martin]]) based in [[Riviera Beach, Florida]].  Based on the technology transfer, the [[Shenyang Institute of Automation]] of the [[Chinese Academy of Science]] and Perry Oceanographic jointly developed the RECON-IV ROUV, which was adopted by People's Liberation Army Navy for salvage and rescue operations.  However, like earlier ROUVs, the RECON-IV is primarily designed for civilian operations and had its limitations in performing certain military operations, such as cutting through specialized steel used to build certain compartments of submarines that were stranded, and opening some valves on sinking vessels, thus a more capable follow-up was needed.

==8A4 ROUV==
To develop a ROUV that meets the special needs of military salvage and rescue operations that was not commercially available on the market, China organized a design team in the late 1980s including the 702nd Research Institute of [[China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation]] (CSIC), the Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of [[Harbin Engineering University]] (HEU), and the Institute of Underwater Engineering of [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] (SHJTU), with a professor of SHJTU, Mr. Xu Huangnan (徐芑南), and the future deputy general designer of [[Explorer AUV]], and the future general designer of other Chinese unmanned underwater vehicles including [[Sea Dragon class ROUV]], [[CR class AUV]], and [[SJT class ROUV]], was named as the general designer of the 8A4 ROUV.  The goal was to develop an ROUV primarily used for military applications, while also capable of performing civilian tasks as the secondary mission.

To shorten the time needed, the decision was made to develop an ROUV based on existing technology by first selecting a system available on the market with performance closest to the requirements, and then improving the commercially available system based on the experienced gained from the RECON-IV ROUV developed earlier. The AMETEK 2006, an American ROUV used to support offshore oil drilling operations, was selected because it was the one that met the requirements best, while also being the one China could purchase on the international market at the time.  However, despite meeting Chinese requirements better than all of the rest available systems, it was far from getting close, so extensive improvements were needed.  One of the major upgrades needed was the complete redesign and incorporation of two manipulators that were required to operate around half a dozen tools underwater.<ref>[http://ch.hust.edu.cn/xsky/news.asp?id=91 Manipulators of the 8A4 ROUV (in Chinese)]</ref>  These manipulators were completed by the main subcontractor, the [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]] (HUST), and eventually won 1st Place in the Scientific and Technological Advancement Award of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation in 1996.

The first 8A4 ROUV completed sea trials in 1993 and subsequently entered service.  During its evaluation, the 8A4 ROUV successfully opened a submarine compartment constructed of special steel, a feat no other ROUV in Chinese inventory could achieve, and the 8A4 was thus dubbed as the most capable salvage and rescue ROUV in Chinese service. The 8A4 is capable of operating at a depth of up to 600 meters, with a cruising radius of up to 150 meters, and it was one of the first ROUVs in Chinese inventory to incorporate a Tether Management System (TMS).  In 1996, the 8A4 ROUV won 3rd Place in the Scientific and Technological Advancement Award of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation.  Despite the success and awards received, the 8A4 class ROUV is severely limited in its capability during actual deployment due to financial constraints. With the exception of the very first unit, all of the remaining 8A4 ROUVs have their TMS deleted due to the budget cuts, resulting in significant reduction in performance.  For example, the maximum operational depth is reduced by more than half. It is not until the early 2010s during the scheduled overhaul would the TMS be planned to be reintroduced to all the 8A4 ROUVs to achieve their full capability.

==7B8 ROUV==
The 7B8 ROUV is a further development of the 8A4 ROUV, and it is a Chinese transition from ROUV to [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV).  Designed by the Shipbuilding Engineering Institute of [[Harbin Engineering University]] (HEU) based on the experience of the 8A4 ROUV with Mr. Deng Sanrui (邓三瑞) as the general designer, the 7B8 ROUV was first revealed to the Chinese public in [[Beijing]] during the National Science and Technology Exhibition of the [[People's Liberation Army]] at the [[Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution]] in 1995 while still under development, and members of the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] headed by General [[Liu Huaqing]] was among those special guests.

The 7B8 ROUV is unique in that in comparison to other Chinese ROUVs, it can also operate independently as an AUV in addition to being operated remotely via tether/cable like ordinary ROUVs. The 7B8 first completed its trials as an ROUV in the 1990s and in 2000. Then it completed AUV trials including autonomously searching underwater targets and autonomous underwater work, and subsequently entered service.  When the 7B8 is operated as an AUV, the maximum operating depth is less than when operating as an ROUV.

Specifications:
* Length: 4.33 meters
* Width: 1.27 meters
* Height: 1.76 meters
* Weight: 1.69 tons
* Operating depth: 100 meters (when operating as an [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|AUV]])

{{graph search algorithm}}
In [[computer science]], '''A*''' (pronounced "A star") is a [[computer algorithm]] that is widely used in [[pathfinding]] and [[graph traversal]], the process of plotting an efficiently traversable path between points, called nodes. Noted for its [[Computer performance|performance]] and accuracy, it enjoys widespread use. [[Peter E. Hart|Peter Hart]], [[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]], and [[Bertram Raphael]] first described the algorithm in 1968<ref>{{cite journal

</ref>. It is an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's [[Dijkstra's algorithm|1959 algorithm]]. A* achieves better performance (with respect to time) by using [[heuristics]].

==Description==

A* uses a [[best-first search|best-first]] search and finds the least-cost path from a given initial [[node (graph theory)|node]] to one [[goal node]] (out of one or more possible goals).

It uses a distance-plus-cost [[heuristic]] function (usually denoted <math>f(x)</math>) to determine the order in which the search visits nodes in the tree. The distance-plus-cost heuristic is a sum of two functions: 
* the path-cost function, which is the cost from the starting node to the current node (usually denoted <math>g(x)</math>)
* and an [[Admissible heuristic|admissible]] "heuristic estimate" of the distance to the goal (usually denoted <math>h(x)</math>).

The <math>h(x)</math> part of the <math>f(x)</math> function must be an [[admissible heuristic]]; that is, it must not overestimate the distance to the goal. Thus, for an application like [[routing]], <math>h(x)</math> might represent the straight-line distance to the goal, since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two points or nodes.

If the [[heuristic]] ''h'' satisfies the additional condition <math>h(x) \le d(x,y) + h(y)</math> for every edge ''x, y'' of the graph (where ''d'' denotes the length of that edge), then ''h'' is called [[Consistent heuristic|monotone, or consistent]]. In such a case, A* can be implemented more efficiently—roughly speaking, no node needs to be processed more than once (see ''closed set'' below)—and A* is equivalent to running [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] with the [[reduced cost]] <math>d'(x, y) := d(x, y) - h(x) + h(y)</math>.

Note that A* has been generalized into a bidirectional heuristic search algorithm; see [[bidirectional search]].

==History==
In 1964 Nils Nilsson invented a heuristic based approach to increase the speed of Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm was called A1. In 1967 Bertram Raphael made dramatic improvements upon this algorithm, but failed to show optimality. He called this algorithm A2. Then in 1968 Peter E. Hart introduced an argument that proved A2 was optimal when using a consistent heuristic with only minor changes. His proof of the algorithm also included a section that showed that the new A2 algorithm was the best algorithm possible given the conditions. He thus named the new algorithm in [[Kleene star]] syntax to be the algorithm that starts with A and includes all possible version numbers or A*.
<ref>http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/
</ref>

==Concepts==

As A* traverses the graph, it follows a path of the lowest ''known'' cost, keeping a sorted [[priority queue]] of alternate path segments along the way. If, at any point, a segment of the path being traversed has a higher cost than another encountered path segment, it abandons the higher-cost path segment and traverses the lower-cost path segment instead. This process continues until the goal is reached.

==Process==

[[Image:A+ Pathfinding Algorithm.png|thumb|A single-step simulation]]
Like all [[informed search algorithm]]s, it first searches the routes that ''appear'' to be most likely to lead towards the goal. What sets A* apart from a [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] [[best-first search]] is that it also takes the distance already traveled into account; the <math>g(x)</math> part of the heuristic is the cost from the start, not simply the local cost from the previously expanded node.

Starting with the initial node, it maintains a [[priority queue]] of nodes to be traversed, known as the ''open set'' (not to be confused with [[open set]]s in [[topology]]). The lower <math>f(x)</math> for a given node <math>x</math>, the higher its priority. At each step of the algorithm, the node with the lowest <math>f(x)</math> value is removed from the queue, the <math>f</math> and <math>h</math> values of its neighbors are updated accordingly, and these neighbors are added to the queue. The algorithm continues until a goal node has a lower <math>f</math> value than any node in the queue (or until the queue is empty). (Goal nodes may be passed over multiple times if there remain other nodes with lower <math>f</math> values, as they may lead to a shorter path to a goal.) The <math>f</math> value of the goal is then the length of the shortest path, since <math>h</math> at the goal is zero in an admissible heuristic. If the actual shortest path is desired, the algorithm may also update each neighbor with its immediate predecessor in the best path found so far; this information can then be used to reconstruct the path by working backwards from the goal node. Additionally, if the heuristic is ''monotonic'' (or [[Consistent heuristic|consistent]], see below), a ''closed set'' of nodes already traversed may be used to make the search more efficient.

==Pseudocode==

The following [[pseudocode]] describes the algorithm:
<source lang="matlab">
 function A*(start,goal)
     closedset := the empty set                 // The set of nodes already evaluated.     
     openset := set containing the initial node // The set of tentative nodes to be evaluated.
     came_from := the empty map                 // The map of navigated nodes.
     g_score[start] := 0                        // Distance from start along optimal path.
     h_score[start] := heuristic_estimate_of_distance(start, goal)
     f_score[start] := h_score[start]           // Estimated total distance from start to goal through y.
     while openset is not empty
         x := the node in openset having the lowest f_score[] value
         if x = goal
             return reconstruct_path(came_from, came_from[goal])
         remove x from openset
         add x to closedset
         foreach y in neighbor_nodes(x)
             if y in closedset
                 continue
             tentative_g_score := g_score[x] + dist_between(x,y)
             
             if y not in openset
                 add y to openset
                 tentative_is_better := true
             elseif tentative_g_score &amp;lt; g_score[y]
                 tentative_is_better := true
             else
                 tentative_is_better := false
             if tentative_is_better = true
                 came_from[y] := x
                         
                 g_score[y] := tentative_g_score
                 h_score[y] := heuristic_estimate_of_distance(y, goal)
                 f_score[y] := g_score[y] + h_score[y]
     return failure

 function reconstruct_path(came_from, current_node)
     if came_from[current_node] is set
         p = reconstruct_path(came_from, came_from[current_node])
         return (p + current_node)
     else
         return current_node
</source>

The closed set can be omitted (yielding a tree search algorithm) if a solution is guaranteed to exist, or if the algorithm is adapted so that new nodes are added to the open set only if they have a lower <math>f</math> value than at any previous iteration.

===Example===
An example of A star (A*) algorithm in action where nodes are cities connected with roads and h(x) is the straight-line distance to target point: 

[[File:AstarExample.gif|An example of A star (A*) algorithm in action (nodes are cities connected with roads, h(x) is the straight-line distance to target point) Green: Start, Blue: Target, Orange: Visited]]

'''Key:''' green: start; blue: goal; orange: visited

'''Note:''' This example uses a comma as the [[decimal separator]].

==Properties==
Like [[breadth-first search]], A* is ''complete'' and will always find a solution if one exists.

If the heuristic function <math>h</math> is [[Admissible heuristic|admissible]], meaning that it never overestimates the actual minimal cost of reaching the goal, then A* is itself admissible (or ''optimal'') if we do not use a closed set. If a closed set is used, then <math>h</math> must also be ''monotonic'' (or [[Consistent heuristic|consistent]]) for A* to be optimal. This means that for any pair of adjacent nodes <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, where <math>d(x,y)</math> denotes the length of the edge between them, we must have:

:<math>h(x) \le d(x,y) + h(y)</math>

This ensures that for any path <math>X</math> from the initial node to <math>x</math>:

:<math>L(X) + h(x) \le L(X) + d(x,y) + h(y) = L(Y) + h(y)</math>

where <math>L(\cdot)</math> denotes the length of a path, and <math>Y</math> is the path <math>X</math> extended to include <math>y</math>. In other words, it is impossible to decrease (total distance so far + estimated remaining distance) by extending a path to include a neighboring node. (This is analogous to the restriction to nonnegative edge weights in [[Dijkstra's algorithm]].) Monotonicity implies admissibility when the heuristic estimate at any goal node itself is zero, since (letting <math>P = (f,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n,g)</math> be a shortest path from any node <math>f</math> to the nearest goal <math>g</math>):

:<math>h(f) \le d(f,v_1) + h(v_1) \le d(f,v_1) + d(v_1,v_2) + h(v_2) \le \ldots \le L(P) + h(g) = L(P)</math>

A* is also optimally efficient for any heuristic <math>h</math>, meaning that no algorithm employing the same heuristic will expand fewer nodes than A*, except when there are multiple partial solutions where <math>h</math> exactly predicts the cost of the optimal path. Even in this case, for each graph there exists some order of breaking ties in the priority queue such that A* examines the fewest possible nodes.

===Special cases===
[[Dijkstra's algorithm]], as another example of a uniform-cost search search algorithm, can be viewed as a special case of A* where <math>h(x) = 0</math> for all <math>x</math>. General [[depth-first search]] can be implemented using the A* by considering that there is a global counter ''C'' initialized with a very large value. Every time we process a node we assign ''C'' to all of its newly discovered neighbors. After each single assignment, we decrease the counter ''C'' by one. Thus the earlier a node is discovered, the higher its <math>h(x)</math> value.  It should be noted, however, that both Dijkstra's algorithm and depth-first search can be implemented more efficiently without including a <math>h(x)</math> value at each node.

===Implementation details===
There are a number of simple optimizations or implementation details that can significantly affect the performance of an A* implementation.  The first detail to note is that the way the priority queue handles ties can have a significant effect on performance in some situations.  If ties are broken so the queue behaves in a [[LIFO (computing)|LIFO]] manner, A* will behave like [[depth-first search]] among equal cost paths. 

When a path is required at the end of the search, it is common to keep with each node a reference to that node's parent.  At the end of the search these references can be used to recover the optimal path.  If these references are being kept then it can be important that the same node doesn't appear in the priority queue more than once (each entry corresponding to a different path to the node, and each with a different cost).  A standard approach here is to check if a node about to be added already appears in the priority queue.  If it does, then the priority and parent pointers are changed to correspond to the lower cost path.  When finding a node in a queue to perform this check, many standard implementations of a [[Heap (data structure)|min-heap]] require <math>O(n)</math> time.  Augmenting the heap with a [[hash table]] can reduce this to constant time.

==Admissibility and optimality{{anchor|Admissibility and Optimality}}==
A* is admissible and considers fewer nodes than any other admissible search algorithm with the same heuristic. This is because A* uses an "optimistic" estimate of the cost of a path through every node that it considers—optimistic in that the true cost of a path through that node to the goal will be at least as great as the estimate. But, critically, as far as A* "knows", that optimistic estimate might be achievable.

Here is the main idea of the proof:

When A* terminates its search, it has found a path whose actual cost is lower than the estimated cost of any path through any open node. But since those estimates are optimistic, A* can safely ignore those nodes. In other words, A* will never overlook the possibility of a lower-cost path and so is admissible.

Suppose now that some other search algorithm B terminates its search with a path whose actual cost is ''not'' less than the estimated cost of a path through some open node. Based on the heuristic information it has, Algorithm B cannot rule out the possibility that a path through that node has a lower cost. So while B might consider fewer nodes than A*, it cannot be admissible. Accordingly, A* considers the fewest nodes of any admissible search algorithm.

This is only true if both:

* A* uses an [[admissible heuristic]]. Otherwise, A* is not guaranteed to expand fewer nodes than another search algorithm with the same heuristic. See (Generalized best-first search strategies and the optimality of A*, Rina Dechter and Judea Pearl, 1985<ref>{{cite journal

</ref>)

* A* solves only one search problem rather than a series of similar search problems. Otherwise, A* is not guaranteed to expand fewer nodes than [[incremental heuristic search]] algorithms.

==Complexity==
The [[computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of A* depends on the heuristic. In the worst case, the number of nodes expanded is [[exponential time|exponential]] in the length of the solution (the shortest path), but it is [[polynomial time|polynomial]] when the search space is a tree, there is a single goal state, and the heuristic function ''h'' meets the following condition:

:<math>|h(x) - h^*(x)| = O(\log h^*(x))</math>

where <math>h^*</math> is the optimal heuristic, the exact cost to get from <math>x</math> to the goal. In other words, the error of ''h'' will not grow faster than the [[logarithm]] of the “perfect heuristic” <math>h^*</math> that returns the true distance from ''x'' to the goal (see Pearl 1984<ref>{{cite book

'''Arthur Richard Newton''' ([[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], 1 July 1951 &amp;ndash; 2 January 2007) was the dean of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]. 

Newton was educated at the [[University of Melbourne]] and received a [[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]] in 1973 and [[Master's degree|M.Eng.Sci]] in 1975.  He worked at Berkeley from 1975 on [[SPICE]] (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), developed initially by Larry Nagel and [[Donald Pederson]] to analyze and design complex electronic circuitry with speed and accuracy. It is claimed that nearly all electronic chips now use SPICE or a derivative.

University of California, Berkeley awarded Newton a [[Ph.D]] in 1978 and he was appointed to the Engineering Faculty a few months later.  He was appointed assistant professor in 1978, associate professor in 1982 and full professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in 1985.  He chaired of department from 1999 to 2000, and was dean of the College of Engineering and the Roy W. Carlson Professor of Engineering from 2000 until his death.

[[Robert Birgeneau]], [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of UC Berkeley described him as, "Dynamic and entrepreneurial, he understood the power of engineering and technology in entirely new ways, and he connected them to addressing society's toughest problems. The vibrancy of his thinking shaped my own ideas about what engineering is and what it can be.  This <nowiki>[his death]</nowiki> is an enormous loss for us at UC Berkeley, for California, and indeed for the international engineering community."

He died at 55 due to [[pancreatic cancer]] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] Medical Center.<ref>{{cite web

'''A/UX''' (from '''A'''pple '''U'''ni'''x''') was [[Apple Computer]]’s implementation of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]] for some of their [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. The later versions of A/UX ran on the [[Macintosh II]], [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]] and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] series of machines as well as the [[Macintosh SE/30|SE/30]]. A/UX was first released in 1988, with the final version (3.1.1) released in 1995. A/UX required a [[68k]]-based Macintosh with an [[Floating point unit|FPU]] and a paged [[memory management unit]] (PMMU).

The operating system was based on [[UNIX System V]] Release 2.2. It included some additional features from System V Releases 3 &amp; 4 and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] versions 4.2 &amp; 4.3. It was [[POSIX]] and [[System V Interface Definition]] (SVID) compliant and included [[TCP/IP]] [[computer network|networking]] from version 2 onward. There were rumors of a later version using [[OSF/1]] as its primary code base, but this system was never released to the public, if it even existed. 

==Features==
A/UX 3.x provided a [[graphical user interface]] with the familiar [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] windows, menus, and controls. The A/UX Finder was not the same program as the [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] Finder, but a customized version adapted to run as a Unix [[Process (computing)|process]] and designed to interact with the Unix [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and [[file system]]s. A/UX 3.x also included a '''CommandShell''' terminal program, which offered a [[command line interface]] to the underlying Unix system, a feature which had never been available on Macintosh computers running the classic [[Mac OS]] Finder. An [[X Window System]] server application (called '''MacX''') with a terminal program could also be used to interface with the system and run X applications directly in the Finder. Alternatively, the user could choose to run a full X11R4 session without the Finder.

By including a [[compatibility layer]], A/UX could run [[Macintosh System]] 7.0.1, Unix, and "hybrid" [[Application software|application]]s. A hybrid application used both Macintosh and Unix system functions: for example, a Macintosh application which called Unix system functions, or a Unix application which called [[Macintosh Toolbox]] (e.g. [[QuickDraw]]) functions. The compatibility layer used some existing Toolbox functions in the computer’s [[Read-only memory|ROM]], while other function calls were translated into native Unix [[system call]]s.

A/UX included a utility called '''Commando''' (similar to a tool of the same name included with [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop|MPW]]) to assist users with entering [[Unix commands]]. Opening a Unix [[executable]] file from the Finder would open a [[dialog box]] that allowed the user to choose [[Command line interface|command-line]] options for the program using standard controls such as [[radio button]]s and [[check box]]es, and display the resulting command line [[Parameter (computer science)|argument]] for the user before executing the command or program. This feature was intended to ease the [[Experience curve effects|learning curve]] for users new to Unix, and decrease the user’s reliance on the [[Unix manual]].

A/UX users had one central source for most A/UX applications, a [[Server (computing)|server]] at [[NASA]] called “Jagubox” administered by [[Jim Jagielski]], who was also the editor of the A/UX [[FAQ]]. Although Jagubox is down, some [[Mirror (computing)|mirrors]] are still maintained. 

==Decline==
The last version of A/UX, 3.1.1, was released in 1995. A/UX ran only on 68k Apple machines with a floating point unit (FPU) and a paged memory management unit (PMMU).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/oshistory/4.html |title=Many Systems for Many Apples |first=Amit |last=Singh |publisher=Kernel Thread |date=February 2004}}</ref> Apple never [[Porting|ported]] A/UX to [[PowerPC]] Macintoshes (though A/UX 4.0 was rumored to have been an [[OSF/1]] adaptation), and the company all but abandoned it by 1996, preferring to use a slightly modified version of IBM’s [[AIX operating system|AIX]] system on their mid-90s [[Apple Network Server]]s. After [[Steve Jobs]] returned to Apple, another [[Unix-like]] operating system was introduced in the form of [[Mac OS X]], but it had very little in common with A/UX, instead being based on the [[BSD]]-derived [[NeXTSTEP]].

Aside from a few isolated servers still running it, A/UX is essentially extinct, and is considered to be [[abandonware]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

<title>A20 line</title>
<text>{{refimprove|date=October 2010}}
The '''A20''' or ''addressing line 20'' is one of the plethora of [[electrical]] lines that make up the [[system bus]] of an [[x86]]-based computer system. The A20 line in particular is used to transmit the 21st bit on the [[address bus]].

A microprocessor will typically have a number of addressing lines equal to the base-two [[logarithm]] of its physical addressing space. For example a processor with 4 [[Gibibyte|GiB]] of physical addressing space requires 32 lines, which are named A0 through A31. The lines are named after the number of the bit in the address they are transmitting. Thus, A0 will transmit the [[least significant bit]], which is bit 0. A20 transmits bit 21 and will become active once addresses reach 1 [[Mebibyte|MiB]] or 2<sup>20</sup>. 
[[File:IBM PC Memory areas.svg|thumb|right|The high memory area is available in real mode on 80286 processors if the A20 gate is not disabled]]

== History ==
The early [[Intel 8086]], [[Intel 8088]], and [[Intel 80186]] processors had 20 address lines, numbered A0 to A19, with these the processor can access 2<sup>20</sup> bytes or 1 [[Mebibyte|MiB]]. The processors were designed to access only blocks ("segments") of 64 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] directly (64KiB = 2<sup>16</sup> - 16-bit offset). Which chunk of physical memory this offset actually pointed to, was pre-selected with a 16-bit "segment-register" which could be moved in steps of 16 bytes. The resulting address is equal to Segment * 16 + Offset.

In consequence there were various ways to address the same byte in memory. Exemplary, four of 4096 different segment:offset combinations, all referencing the byte whose physical address is 0x000FFFFF (the last byte in 1 MiB-memory space), are:

:F000:FFFF
:FFFF:000F
:F555:AAAF
:F800:7FFF 

Referenced the last way, an increase of one in the offset yields F800:8000, which is a proper address for the processor, but since it translates to the physical address 0x00100000 (the first byte over 1 MiB) the processor would need another address-line to actually access this byte. Since such a line doesn't exist on the 8086 line of processors, the 21<sup>st</sup> bit above, while set, gets dropped, causing the address F800:8000 to "wrap around" and to actually point to the physical address 0x0000000. 

Because loading segment registers was very slow on early processors, this trick was used by some DOS programmers, for example, to have one segment that has access to program data (e.g. from F800:0000 to F800:7FFF, pointing to the physical addresses 0x000F8000 - 0x000FFFFF) as well as the I/O data (e.g. keyboard buffer) that was located in the first memory segment (with addresses F800:8000 to F800:FFFF pointing to the physical addresses 0x00000000 to 0x00007FFF).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

When [[IBM]] designed the [[IBM PC AT]] machine, they decided to use the new higher-performance [[Intel 80286]] microprocessor. The 80286 could address up to 16 [[Mebibyte|MiB]] of system memory, thus removing the ability for memory addresses to wrap around: Since the required address line now existed, the combination F800:8000 would no longer point to the physical address 0x0000000 but the correct address 0x00100000. As a result some DOS programs would no longer work. In order to remain compatible with these programs, IBM decided to fix the problem themselves, on the [[motherboard]].

This was accomplished by inserting a [[logic gate]] on the A20 line between the processor and system bus, which logically got named ''Gate-A20''. Gate-A20 can be enabled or disabled by software to allow or prevent the address bus from receiving a signal from A20. It is set to non-passing for the execution of older programs which rely on the wrap-around. At boot time, the [[BIOS]] first enables Gate-A20 when counting and testing all of the system's memory, and disables it before transferring control to the operating system.

Originally, the logic gate was a gate connected to the [[Intel 8042]] keyboard controller. Controlling it was a relatively slow process. Other methods have since been added to allow for more efficient multitasking of programs which require this wrap-around with programs that access all of the system's memory. There was at first a variety of methods, but eventually the industry settled on the PS/2 method of using a bit in port 92h to control the A20 line.

Disconnecting A20 would not wrap '''all''' memory accesses above 1 MiB, just those in the 1 MiB-2 MiB, 3 MiB-4 MiB, 5 MiB-6 MiB, etc. ranges. [[Real mode]] software only cared about the area slightly above 1 MiB, so Gate-A20 was enough.

Enabling the Gate-A20 line is one of the first steps a [[protected mode]] [[x86]] [[operating system]] does in the bootup process, often before control has been passed onto the kernel from the [[booting|bootstrap]] (in the case of Linux, for example).

[[Virtual 8086 mode]], introduced with the [[Intel 80386]], allows the A20 wrap-around to be simulated by using the [[virtual memory]] facilities of the processor: physical memory may be mapped to multiple virtual addresses thus allowing the memory mapped at first mebibyte of virtual memory may be mapped again in the second mebibyte of virtual memory. The operating system may intercept changes to Gate A20 and make corresponding changes to the virtual memory address space, which also makes irrelevant the efficiency of Gate-A20 toggling.

==A20 handler==
The '''A20 handler''' is [[IBM PC]] [[memory manager]] software controlling access to the [[high memory area]] (HMA). [[Extended memory]] managers usually provide this functionality. A20 handlers are named after the 21st address line of the microprocessor, the A20 line.

In MS-DOS, [[high memory area]] managers, such as [[HIMEM.SYS]] has the "extra task" of managing A20. [[HIMEM.SYS]] provided an [[API]] for opening/closing A20. DOS itself could utilize the area for some of its storage needs, thereby freeing up more conventional memory for programs. This functionality was enabled by the "DOS=HIGH" directive in the [[CONFIG.SYS]] configuration file.

Controlling the A20 line was an important feature at one stage in the growth of the IBM PC architecture, as it added access to an additional 65520 bytes (64 KiB - 16 B) of memory in [[real mode]] without dramatic software changes.

In what was arguably a "hack", the A20 gate was originally part of the keyboard controller on the motherboard, which could open/close it depending on what behaviour was desired. <ref> Tom Shanley, Don Anderson, John Swindle, ''
ISA system architecture'', Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-40996-8, pp.79-80 </ref> 
The A20 gate is still present on all modern PC's and the gate is initially closed right after boot. Modern [[protected mode]] operating systems typically open the A20 gate early during the boot process and never close it again. These operating systems do not have the compatibility reasons for keeping it closed and they gain access to the full range of physical addresses available by opening it.

The [[Intel 80486]] and [[Pentium]] added a special pin named ''A20M#'', which when asserted low forces bit 20 of the physical address to be zero for all on-chip cache or external memory accesses. This enhancement is mostly significant for mainboard manufacturers, because it makes parts of the external Gate A20 circuitry unnecessary. Software still needs to manipulate the gate and must still deal with external peripherals (the [[chipset]]) for that. <ref> Tom Shanley,''Protected mode software architecture'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996 ,ISBN 0-201-55447-X, page  60 </ref>

The [[Lockheed Martin]] A2100 geosynchronous spacecraft series is designed for a variety of telecommunications needs including [[Ka-band]] [[broadband]] and [[broadcast]] services, fixed satellite services in [[C-band]] and Ku-band payload configurations, high-power direct broadcast services using the Ku-band [[frequency spectrum]], and mobile satellite services using [[UHF]], [[L-band]] and [[S-band]] payloads.<ref>[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/lockheed_a2100.htm skyrocket.de "Lockheed Martin: A2100"]</ref> 

The A2100 satellite system was developed by a [[Skunk Works]] team at the Astro Space East Windsor, New Jersey facility.  A group of design Architects, including Brian Stewart, John Close, Pete Wise and Keith Davies delivered a flexible common bus with substantially fewer components, lower spacecraft weight, and reduced customer delivery time.  Jim Wilson led a team from GE's corporate r&amp;d lab located in Niskayuna, NY, which helped with several technology underpinnings which advanced the A2100 design.

The first A2100 satellite, AMC-1, was launched September 8, 1996. Since then, over 30 A2100 based satellites have been launched and have totalled over 200 years of on-orbit service.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2008/space-080212-lockheed-martin01.htm globalsecurity.org "Lockheed Martin-Built A2100 Satellite Fleet Achieves 200 Years In Orbit"]</ref>

<title>AA tree</title>
<text>An '''AA tree''' in [[computer science]] is a form of [[Self-balancing binary search tree|balanced tree]] used for storing and retrieving ordered data efficiently. AA trees are named for [[Arne Andersson (computer science)|Arne Andersson]], their inventor.

AA trees are a variation of the [[red-black tree]], which in turn is an enhancement to the [[binary search tree]]. Unlike red-black trees, red nodes on an AA tree can only be added as a right subchild. In other words, no red node can be a left sub-child.  This results in the simulation of a [[2-3 tree]] instead of a [[2-3-4 tree]], which greatly simplifies the maintenance operations. The maintenance algorithms for a red-black tree need to consider seven different shapes to properly balance the tree:

[[Image:Red Black Shape Cases.svg]]

An AA tree on the other hand only needs to consider two shapes due to the strict requirement that only right links can be red:

[[Image:AA Tree Shape Cases.svg]]

== Balancing Rotations ==

Typically, AA trees are implemented with levels instead of colors, unlike red-black trees.  Each node has a level field, and the following invariants must remain true for the tree to be valid:

# The level of a leaf node is one.
# The level of a left child is strictly less than that of its parent.
# The level of a right child is less than or equal to that of its parent.
# The level of a right grandchild is strictly less than that of its grandparent.
# Every node of level greater than one must have two children.

Only two operations are needed for maintaining balance in an AA tree. These operations are called skew and split. Skew is a right rotation when an insertion or deletion creates a left horizontal{{Clarify|What's a ''horizontal link''?|date=July 2010}} link, which can be thought of as a left red link in the red-black tree context. Split is a conditional left rotation when an insertion or deletion creates two horizontal right links, which once again corresponds to two consecutive red links in red-black trees.

         ''Swap the pointers of horizontal left links.''
         L = left(T)
         left(T) := right(L)
         right(L) := T
         '''return''' L

         '''return''' T
     '''end if'''

         left(R) := T
         level(R) := level(R) + 1

     '''else'''
         '''return''' T
     '''end if'''
 '''end function'''

Split: [[Image:AA Tree Split2.svg]]

== Insertion ==

Insertion begins with the normal binary tree search and insertion procedure.  Then, as the call stack unwinds (assuming a recursive implementation of the search), it's easy to check the validity of the tree and perform any rotations as necessary.  If a horizontal left link arises, a skew will be performed, and if two horizontal right links arise, a split will be performed, possibly incrementing the level of the new root node of the current subtree.  Note, in the code as given above, the increment of level(T).  This makes it necessary to continue checking the validity of the tree as the modifications bubble up from the leaves.

 '''function''' insert '''is'''
     '''input:''' X, the value to be inserted, and T, the root of the tree to insert it into.
     '''output:''' A balanced version T including X.
 
     ''Do the normal binary tree insertion procedure.  Set the result of the''
     ''recursive call to the correct child in case a new node was created or the''
     ''root of the subtree changes.''
     '''if''' nil(T) '''then'''
         ''Create a new leaf node with X.''
         '''return''' node(X, 1, Nil, Nil)
     '''else if''' X &amp;lt; value(T) '''then'''
         left(T) := insert(X, left(T))
     '''else if''' X &amp;gt; value(T) '''then'''
         right(T) := insert(X, right(T))
     '''end if'''
     ''Note that the case of X == value(T) is unspecified.  As given, an insert
     will have no effect.  The implementor may desire different behavior.''
 
     ''Perform skew and then split.  The conditionals that determine whether or
     not a rotation will occur or not are inside of the procedures, as given
     above.''
     T := skew(T)
     T := split(T)
 
     '''return T'''
 '''end function'''

== Deletion ==

As in most balanced binary trees, the deletion of an internal node can be turned into the deletion of a leaf node by swapping the internal node with either its closest predecessor or successor, depending on which are in the tree or on the implementor's whims.  Retrieving a predecessor is simply a matter of following one left link and then all of the remaining right links.  Similarly, the successor can be found by going right once and left until a null pointer is found.  Because of the AA property of all nodes of level greater than one having two children, the successor or predecessor node will be in level 1, making their removal trivial.

To re-balance a tree, there are a few approaches.  The one described by Andersson in his [http://user.it.uu.se/~arnea/abs/simp.html original paper] is the simplest, and it is described here, although actual implementations may opt for a more optimized approach.  After a removal, the first step to maintaining tree validity is to lower the level of any nodes whose children are two levels below them, or who are missing children.  Then, the entire level must be skewed and split.  This approach was favored, because when laid down conceptually, it has three easily understood separate steps:

# Decrease the level, if appropriate.
# Skew the level.
# Split the level.

However, we have to skew and split the entire level this time instead of just a node, complicating our code.

 '''function''' delete '''is'''
     '''input:''' X, the value to delete, and T, the root of the tree from which it should be deleted.
     '''output:''' T, balanced, without the value X.
 
     '''if''' X &amp;gt; value(T) '''then'''
         right(T) := delete(X, right(T))
     '''else if''' X &amp;lt; value(T) '''then'''
         left(T) := delete(X, left(T))
     '''else'''
         ''If we're a leaf, easy, otherwise reduce to leaf case.'' 
         '''if''' leaf(T) '''then'''
             return Nil
         '''else if''' nil(left(T)) '''then'''
             L := successor(T)
             right(T) := delete(L, right(T))
             value(T) := L
         '''else'''
             L := predecessor(T)
             left(T) := delete(L, left(T))
             value(T) := L
         '''end if'''
     '''end if'''
 
     ''Rebalance the tree.  Decrease the level of all nodes in this level if
     necessary, and then skew and split all nodes in the new level.''
     T := decrease_level(T)
     T := skew(T)
     right(T) := skew(right(T))
     right(right(T)) := skew(right(right(T)))
     T := split(T)
     right(T) := split(right(T))
     return T
 '''end function'''

 '''function''' decrease_level '''is'''
     '''input:''' T, a tree for which we want to remove links that skip levels.
     '''output:''' T with its level decreased.
 
     should_be = min(level(left(T)), level(right(T))) + 1
     '''if''' should_be &amp;lt; level(T) '''then'''
         level(T) := should_be
         '''if''' should_be &amp;lt; level(right(T)) '''then'''
             level(right(T)) := should_be
         '''end if'''
     '''end if'''
     return T
 '''end function'''

A good example of deletion by this algorithm is present in the [http://user.it.uu.se/~arnea/abs/simp.html Andersson paper].

== Performance ==

The performance of an AA tree is equivalent to the performance of a red-black tree. While an AA tree makes more rotations than a red-black tree, the simpler algorithms tend to be faster, and all of this balances out to result in similar performance. A red-black tree is more consistent in its performance than an AA tree, but an AA tree tends to be flatter, which results in slightly faster search times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

<title>AC0</title>
<text>{{DISPLAYTITLE:AC<sup>0</sup>}}
'''AC<sup>0</sup>''' is a [[complexity class]] used in [[circuit complexity]].  It is the smallest class in the [[AC (complexity)|AC]] hierarchy, and consists of all families of circuits of depth O(1) and polynomial size, with unlimited-[[fanin]] [[AND gate]]s and [[OR gate]]s.  (We allow [[NOT gate]]s only at the inputs).  It thus contains [[NC0|NC<sup>0</sup>]], which has only bounded-fanin AND and OR gates.

From a [[descriptive complexity]] viewpoint, [[DLOGTIME]]-[[Uniformity (complexity theory)|uniform]] AC<sup>0</sup> is equal to the descriptive class [[FO (complexity)|FO]]+BIT of all languages describable in first-order logic with the addition of the [[BIT operator]], or alternatively by FO(+, <math>\times</math>), or by Turing machine in the [[LH (complexity)|logarithmic hierarchy]]<ref>*N. Immerman ''Descriptive complexity'' (1999 Springer), page 85.</ref>. 

In 1984 Furst, Saxe, and Sipser showed that calculating the [[parity bit#Parity|parity]] of an input cannot be decided by any AC<sup>0</sup> circuits, even with non-uniformity.
<ref>M. Furst, J. B. Saxe, and M. Sipser.  Parity, circuits, and the polynomial-time hierarchy.  ''Math. Systems Theory'', 17:13&amp;ndash;27, 1984.</ref>
It follows that AC<sup>0</sup> is not equal to [[NC1 (complexity)|NC<sup>1</sup>]], because a family of circuits in the latter class can compute parity.

An '''AC/AC converter''' converts an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[waveform]] such as the mains supply, to another AC waveform, where the output voltage and frequency can be set arbitrarily.

AC/AC converters can be categorized into 
* Converters with a DC-link.
* [[Cycloconverter]]s
* Hybrid Matrix Converters.
* Matrix Converters.
As shown in Fig 1.
For such AC-AC conversion today typically converter systems with a voltage (Fig. 2) or current (Fig. 3) DC-link are employed. For the voltage DC-link, the mains coupling could be implemented by a diode bridge. To accomplish braking operation of a motor, a braking resistor must be placed in the DC-link. Alternatively, an anti-parallel thyristor bridge must be provided on the mains side for feeding back energy into the mains. The disadvantages of this solution are the relatively high mains distortion and high reactive power requirements (especially during inverter operation). 

An AC/AC converter with approximately sinusoidal input currents and bidirectional power flow can be realized by coupling a PWM rectifier and a PWM inverter to the DC-link. The DC-link quantity is then impressed by an energy storage element that is common to both stages, which is a capacitor C for the voltage DC-link or an inductor L for the current DC-link. The PWM rectifier is controlled in a way that a sinusoidal mains current is drawn, which is in phase or anti-phase (for energy feedback) with the corresponding mains phase voltage. 

Due to the DC-link storage element, there is the advantage that both converter stages are to a large extent decoupled for control purposes. Furthermore, a constant, mains independent input quantity exists for the PWM inverter stage, which results in high utilization of the converter’s power capability. On the other hand, the DC-link energy storage element has a relatively large physical volume, and when electrolytic capacitors are used, in the case of a voltage DC-link, there is potentially a reduced system lifetime. 

In order to achieve higher power density and reliability, it is makes sense to consider Matrix Converters that achieve three-phase AC/AC conversion without any intermediate energy storage element. Conventional Direct Matrix Converters (Fig. 4) perform voltage and current conversion in one single stage. 

A [[cycloconverter]] constructs an output, variable-frequency, approximately sinusoid waveform by switching segments of the input waveform to the output; there is no intermediate DC link.  With switching elements such as [[SCR]]s, the output frequency must be lower than the input. Very large cycloconverters (on the order of 10 MW) are manufactured for compressor and wind-tunnel drives, or for variable-speed applications such as [[cement]] kilns.   

There is the alternative option of indirect energy conversion by employing the Indirect Matrix Converter (Fig. 5) or the Sparse Matrix Converter which was invented by Prof. Johann W. Kolar from the ETH Zurich. As with the DC-link based systems (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), separate stages are provided for voltage and current conversion, but the DC-link has no intermediate storage element. Generally, by employing matrix converters, the storage element in the DC-link is eliminated at the cost of a larger number of semiconductors. Matrix converters are often seen as a future concept for variable speed drives technology, but despite intensive research over the decades they have until now only achieved low industrial penetration. The reason for this could be the higher complexity in modulation and analysis effort.

<title>ACCESS.bus</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}

'''ACCESS.bus''' (or '''A.b''') is a peripheral-interconnect [[computer bus]] developed by [[Philips]] in the early 1990s. It is similar in purpose to [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], in that it allows low-speed devices to be added or removed from a computer on the fly. While it was in use earlier than USB, it never became popular, largely due to considerably less corporate backing in the industry.

A.b is a [[physical layer]] definition that describes the physical cabling and connectors used in the network. The higher layers, namely the signaling and protocol issues, are already defined to be the same as Philips' [[I²C]] bus.

Compared to I²C, A.b:

* adds two additional pins to provide power to the devices (+5 V and GND)
* allows for only 125 devices out of I²C's 1024
* supports only the 100 kbit/s "standard mode" and 10 kbit/s "low-speed mode"

The idea was to define a single standard that could be used both inside and outside a computer. A single I²C/A.b controller chip would be used inside the machine, connected on the [[motherboard]] to internal devices like the clock and battery power monitor. An A.b connector on the outside would then allow additional devices to be plugged into the bus. This way all of the low- and medium-speed devices on the machine would be driven by a single controller and [[protocol stack]].

A.b also defined a small set of standardized device classes. These included monitors, keyboards, "locators" (pointing devices like mice and joysticks), battery monitors, and "text devices" (modems, etc.). Depending on how much intelligence the device needed, the interface in the device could leave almost all of the work to the [[device driver|driver]]. This allows A.b to scale down to price points low enough for devices like mice.

Although A.b mice and keyboards have been available (in limited fashion) for some time, the only serious attempt to use the system was by the [[VESA]] group. They needed a standardized bus for communicating device abilities between monitors and computers, and selected I²C because it required only two pins; by re-using existing "reserved" pins in the standard [[VGA]] they could implement a complete A.b bus (including power). A number of monitors with A.b connectors started appearing in the mid-1990s, notably those by [[NEC]], but this was at about the same time USB was being heavily promoted and few devices were available to plug into them. The bus remained the standard way for a monitor to communicate setup information to the host graphics card.

Compared to USB, A.b has several advantages. One is that any device on the bus can be a master or a slave, and a protocol is defined for selecting which one a device should use under any particular circumstance. This allows devices to be plugged together with A.b without a host computer. For instance, a digital camera could be plugged directly into a printer and become the master. Under USB the computer is always the master and the devices are always slaves. In order to support the same sort of device-to-device connection, USB requires additional support in the dual-role devices in order to emulate a host and provide similar functionality. Another advantage of A.b is that devices can be strung together into a single daisy-chain&amp;mdash;A.b can support, but does not require, the use of hubs. This can reduce cable-clutter significantly.

On the downside, A.b is much slower than USB. Had [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]] (also known as FireWire) been widely available at the time, a computer with both A.b and FireWire would have been an attractive solution for all speed ranges. As it was, USB fit neatly into the niche between the two. With USB soon included in the standard motherboard control chips from [[Intel]], A.b was pushed out onto the low-end and quickly disappeared.

<title>ACM Computing Classification System</title>
<text>The '''ACM Computing Classification System''' is a subject classification system for [[computer science]] devised by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. The system is comparable to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] in scope, aims and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area.

==History==
The system has gone through six revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982,  1983, 1987, 1991, and the now current version in 1998.

==Structure==
The ACM Computing Classification System is hierarchically structured in four levels: three outer levels, coded by capital letters and numbers, and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains
:I. Computing Methodologies, which contains:
::I.2 [[Artificial Intelligence]], which contains:
:::I.2.4 [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], which contains:
::::''[[Temporal logic]]''.

Each top-level category has two standard subcategories: "general", coded with a "0", and "miscellaneous", coded with a "m". For instance, I.0 denotes the "general" subcategory of Computing Methodologies, while I.m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory. Several subtopics are listed as uncoded subject descriptors in these standard subcategories.

==Makeover==
The magazine was originally titled "Crossroads" but in May 2010, it was given a makeover and the title was replaced by the pseudo-acronym "XRDS". Prior to the makeover, the format of the magazine is similar to that of its more illustrious cousin, the [[Communications of the ACM]] where articles are summaries of interesting research papers. With the Summer 2010 issue of XRDS, ACM inaugurates a completely revamped edition of the magazine. Targeted to both graduate and undergraduate students contemplating computing careers, the newly redesigned XRDS offers breaking news and information, practical career advice, and first-hand stories and profiles of people on the front lines of the burgeoning computing field.

The new magazine and its website http://XRDS.acm.org reflect the real voices of today’s students, and will create a hub of interaction and communication for them to access.

XRDS has been designed as an easy-access resource for students who are focused on their futures. Readers now have a convenient channel to find valuable content not only on their field of study but on the student experience as well. With the magazines’ new website, students now have a central place where they can share their ideas and experiences through interactive features and by submitting articles for publication.

<title>ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</title>
<text>[[Image:Icpc logo.png|thumb|right|ACM ICPC logo]]
'''ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest''' (abbreviated as '''ACM-ICPC''' or just '''ICPC''') is an annual multi-tiered computer programming competition among the universities of the world. The contest is sponsored by [[IBM]].  Headquartered at [[Baylor University]], with autonomous regions on six continents, the ICPC is directed by Baylor Professor William B. Poucher, Executive Director, and operates under the auspices of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM).

==History==
The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, [[ICPC]], traces its roots to a competition held at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]] Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference.

From 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams from [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]].  Headquartered at [[Baylor University]] since 1989, with regionals established within the world's university community, operating under the auspices of ACM, and with substantial industry support, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition with teams from 84 countries in 2005.

Since the beginning of [[IBM]]'s sponsorship in 1997, contest participation has grown enormously. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2007, 6,700 teams from 1,821 universities participated. The number of teams keeps increasing by 10-20% every year and future competitions may be even larger.

The World Finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals, ACM-ICPC World Finals, is the final round of competition.  Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide.  [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon|UPE]] recognizes all of the regional champions at the event. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country's head of state and at the annual ACM Awards Ceremony.

==Contest rules==
The ICPC is a team competition. Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students. Participants must be university students, who have had less than five years of university education before the contest. Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/info/default.htm|title=Information - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Regionals/EligibilityDecisionTree.pdf|title=2008 ICPC Regionals Eligibility Decision Diagram|accessdate=2008-06-10|format=PDF}}</ref>

During contest, the teams are given 5 hours to solve between 8 and 12 programming problems (with 8 typical for regionals and 10 for finals). They must submit solutions as programs in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified about that and they can submit another program. 

The winner is the team which correctly solves most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved.

For example, consider a situation when two teams, Red and Blue, tie by solving two problems each. The team Red submitted their solutions to A and B at 1:00 and 2:45 after the beginning of the contest. They had a rejected run on C, but it was ignored since they didn't solve C.  The team Blue submitted solutions to problems A and C at 1:20 and 2:00 after the beginning. They had one rejected run on C.  Then, the total time is 1:00+2:45=3:45 for team Red and 1:20+2:00+0:20=3:40 for team Blue.  The tie is broken in favor of Team Blue.

Compared to other programming contests (for example, [[International Olympiad in Informatics]]), the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems (8 or more problems in just 5 hours). Another feature is that each team can use only one computer, although teams have three students. This makes the time pressure even greater. Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win.

==Regionals and World Finals==
The contest consists of several stages. Many universities hold local contests to determine participants at the regional level. Then, universities compete in Regional contests. Winners of Regional contests advance to the [[ACM-ICPC World Finals]]. More than one team from a university can compete in regionals, but only one may compete at the world finals.  From each region, at least one team goes to World Finals. Regions with large number of teams send multiple teams to finals (sometimes as many as 6 teams from one very large region).

* No participant can take part in more than two World Finals.
* Some large regions also hold Subregional competitions (also called Preliminaries) which are intermediate between local and regional contests.
* In ACM/ICPC, the result has seven different expressions (AC, WA, RTE, TLE, PE, MLE, CE).The result AC means the code is accepted by the system.

==2004 World Finals==
The 2004 ACM-ICPC World Finals were hosted at the Obecni Dum, [[Prague]], by [[Czech Technical University]] in Prague. 3,150 teams representing 1,411 universities from 75 countries competed in elimination rounds, with 73 of those teams proceeding to the world finals.

<title>AD-AS model</title>
<text>{{Cleanup|date=November 2008}}
The '''AD-AS''' or '''Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model''' is a [[macroeconomic model]] that explains [[price level]] and [[output (economics)|output]] through the relationship of [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. It is based on the theory of [[John Maynard Keynes]] presented in his work ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]''. One of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of [[macroeconomics]], and is used by a broad array of economists, from [[libertarian]], [[Monetarist]] supporters of [[laissez-faire]], such as [[Milton Friedman]] to [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] supporters of [[economic interventionism]], such as [[Joan Robinson]].

==Modeling==
The AD/AS model is used to illustrate the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] model of the [[business cycle]]. Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various [[exogeny|exogenous]] events will have on two variables:  real [[GDP]] and the [[price level]].  Furthermore, the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models (models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time).  The AD-AS model can be related to the [[Phillips curve]] model of wage or price inflation and unemployment.

==Aggregate demand curve==
{{main|Aggregate Demand}}
The AD curve is defined by the IS-LM equilibrium income at different potential price levels. 
The equation for the AD curve in general terms is:

: <math>Y=Y^{d}(\tfrac{M}{P}, G, T, Z_1)</math>

where Y is real [[GDP]], M is the nominal [[money supply]], G is real [[government spending]], T is an exogenous component of real taxes levied, P is the [[price level]], and Z<sub>1</sub> is a vector of other exogenous variables that affect the location of the IS curve (exogenous influences on any component of spending) or the LM curve (exogenous influences on money demand).  The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand, as does real government spending (meaning that when the independent variable changes in one direction, aggregate demand changes in the same direction); the exogenous component of taxes has a negative effect on it.

==Aggregate supply curve==
{{main|Aggregate supply}}
The aggregate supply curve may reflect either labor market disequilibrium or labor market equilibrium. In either case, it shows how much output is supplied by firms at various potential price levels.

The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market, called the short-run aggregate supply curve, is  
:<math>Y=Y^{s}(W/P, \ \  P/P^{e}, \ \  Z_2)</math>

where W is the nominal wage rate (exogenous due to stickiness in the short run), P<sup>e</sup> is the anticipated (expected) price level, and Z<sub>2</sub> is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve (the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge).  The real wage has a negative effect on firms' employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply.  The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms' mistakes in production plans due to mis-predictions of prices.

The long-run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally (as would be the terminology in the micro-economic theory of the firm), but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate.  In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation.  The long-run aggregate supply equation is simply
:<math>Y=Y^{s}(Z_2)</math>

and is vertical at the full-employment level of output. In this long-run case, Z<sub>2</sub> also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve (such as population), since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome.

==Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply==
The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right.  Of course, exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction.

===Shifts of aggregate demand===
The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would go up.  In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run, so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, real output would go up; but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment, real output would remain unchanged.

Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve:
* An exogenous increase in consumer spending
* An exogenous increase in investment  spending on [[physical capital]]
* An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment 
* An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services
* An exogenous increase in [[transfer payments]] from the government to the people
* An exogenous decrease in taxes levied
* An exogenous increase in purchases of the country's exports by people in other countries
* An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries

Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve:
* An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply
* An exogenous decrease in the demand for money (in liquidity preference)

===Shifts of aggregate supply===
The following exogenous events would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would drop and real GDP would increase.
* An exogenous decrease in the wage rate
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress &amp;mdash; improvements in our knowledge of how to transform capital and labor into output

The following events would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right:
* An increase in population
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress

<title>ADAPA</title>
<text>{{Fanpov|date=August 2010}}

:''This article is about a decision engine. For the Babylonian and Summerian god of wisdom, see [[Adapa]].'' 

'''ADAPA''' is intrinsically a predictive decisioning platform. It combines the power of [[predictive analytics]] and [[business rules]] to facilitate the tasks of managing and designing automated decisioning systems. 

==Automated decisions==
When first released, ADAPA (Adaptive Decision And Predictive Analytics) was purely a scoring engine, used to produce scores out of [[statistical model]]s expressed in [[PMML]] (Predictive Model Markup Language) format. With the addition of a rules engine to its core, ADAPA is now able to seamlessly combine rules and predictive models, which enables businesses to manage and design automated decisioning systems. In this way, ADAPA allows for the concretization of [[Enterprise Decision Management]] (EDM) solutions.

==PMML support and predictive analytics==
[[Predictive analytics]] comprises a series of modeling techniques which can be used to extract relevant patterns present in large amounts of data to better predict the future.

ADAPA is able to generate scores out of a variety of predictive modeling techniques expressed in [[PMML]]. PMML provides a standard way for the expression of predictive models. In this way, proprietary issues and incompatibilities are no longer a barrier to the exchange of models between applications. 

Currently, ADAPA supports the following PMML elements:

[[File:ADAPA3.0 TwoinOne.png|right|350px|H3|]]

* [[Decision tree learning|Decision Trees]]
* [[Neural Networks]]
* Clustering Models
* Naive Bayes Classifiers
* [[Support Vector Machines]]
* Ruleset Models
* Linear and [[Logistic regression]] as well as all general regression PMML models:
** Multinomial Logistic
** General Linear
** Ordinal Multinomial
** Simple Regression
** [[Generalized linear model]]
** Cox Regression Models

as well as a variety of elements involved in data pre- and post-processing:

* Built-in Functions (logic and arithmetic operators as well as IF-THEN-ELSE)
* Normalization
* Discretization
* Value Mapping
* Functions
* Targets/Scaling
* Outputs
* Model Verification (which in ADAPA can also take the form of a CSV file)

Once a model is uploaded in ADAPA, it can be executed in batch and real-time. ADAPA is a PMML consumer, therefore it is able to execute PMML code exported from tools such as R, SPSS, IBM, SAS, KNIME, KXEN, RapidMiner, etc. 

Besides offering a web-based console to manage models and rule sets, ADAPA includes capabilities to test these under its decision and validation framework.

==Business rules==

[[Business rules]] allow for business process and logic to be expressed outside of programming code. With ADAPA, the integration of predictive analytics and rules is seamless. Simply put, ADAPA allows both data-driven and expert knowledge to be combined into a single and concise solution, executed in real-time or in batch-mode. 

ADAPA allows for business knowledge to be expressed in simple tabular format. In ADAPA, rules can be used to manage the execution of different predictive models depending on the business context. They can also incorporate scores generated by different predictive models throughout the business process. The acting together of the two technologies has the potential to significantly extend the precision of any decision logic. 

ADAPA rules leverage the power of the leading Java [[open-source]] rules engine [[Drools]] which is supported by a strong community of developers and JBoss, a division of [[Red Hat]]. This fast, highly efficient rules engine has proven its excellence in numerous commercial installations. 

All decisions in ADAPA are readily available by the use of [[Web Services]].

==ADAPA To Go==
===PMML Converter===
[[Zementis Inc]] (the maker of ADAPA) has released a PMML converter as an iGoogle gadget. This allows for users to convert older PMML models (versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2) to version 4.0. Besides schema validation, the PMML Converter automatically corrects known issues with PMML code from several sources/vendors. The aim is to successfully validate code in older versions of PMML and convert them to PMML 4.0. Files in PMML 4.0 can also be passed through the converter so that they can be corrected and validated against the 4.0 schema.

The PMML Converter is also embedded in ADAPA itself. And so, if you use ADAPA, there is no need to convert your files, ADAPA will automatically do that for you.

===Software as a Service on the Amazon Cloud===
ADAPA predictive analytics is available through the [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]] (Amazon EC2). It provides the first [[SaaS]] (Software as a Service) predictive decisioning platform. The user can upload and manage several rule sets as well as models expressed in PMML and score data in real-time through the use of web-service calls (ADAPA will automatically convert older versions of PMML to version 3.2 and correct any known issues from different vendors). ADAPA as a Service empowers people, since it allows for anyone anywhere to deploy and use state of the art data mining models.

===ADAPA Add-in for Microsoft Office Excel===
To make the process of executing predictive models even simpler, Zementis also offers the ADAPA add-in for Excel 2007 and 2010 (available for free). With the add-in, anyone in the enterprise is able to score data in Excel by executing models previously deployed in the Cloud.

ADAPA allows for real-time data scoring at any time a new event occurs since it can be used from inside any application via Web Service Calls. Excel is just one such application which happens to be a very well known tool (used by many). This is remarkable, since it frees users from having to deal with all the technology required for scoring their data whenever necessary. With the Excel add-in, all one has to do is to select which data records to score (or the columns and rows containing the relevant data) and pressing on the “Score” button in Excel … et voila’ … new predictions are generated automatically for all selected records.

==ADAPA Flavors==
ADAPA is currently being offered in two ways:
* [http://www.zementis.com/on-the-cloud.htm On the Cloud]: launch your own private instances of ADAPA on the Amazon Cloud.  
* [http://www.zementis.com/site-tour.htm On Site]: ADAPA is also available for deployment on site or on your private cloud.

<text>'''AI@50''', formally known as the "'''Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty Years'''" (July 13–15, 2006), was a conference commemorating the 50th anniversary of the [[Dartmouth Conferences]] which effectively inaugurated the [[history of artificial intelligence]].  Five of the original ten attendees were present: [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Ray Solomonoff]], [[Oliver Selfridge]], [[Trenchard More]], and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0521122937| author=Nilsson, Nils J.| last = Nilsson| first = Nils J.| authorlink=Nils Nilsson (researcher)| title = The Quest for Artificial Intelligence| year = 2009}} pp. 80-81</ref>

While sponsored by [[Dartmouth College]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Frederick Whittemore Foundation]], a $200,000 grant from the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] called for a report of the proceedings that would:

* Analyze progress on AI's original challenges during the first 50 years, and assess whether the challenges were "easier" or "harder" than originally thought and, why

* Document what the AI@50 participants believe are the major research and development challenges facing this field over the next 50 years, and identify what breakthroughs will be needed to meet those challenges

* Relate those challenges and breakthroughs against developments and trends in other areas such as control theory, signal processing, information theory, statistics, and optimization theory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Knapp|first=Susan|title=Dartmouth receives grant from DARPA to support AI@50 conference |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/07/06.html|accessdate=2010-06-11|newspaper=Dartmouth College Office of Public Affairs|date=2006-07-06}}</ref>

Storrs Hall| quote = Self-improvement was one of the aspects of AI proposed for study in the 1956 Dartmouth conference. Turing proposed a “child machine” which could be taught in the human manner to attain adult human-level intelligence. In latter days, the contention that an AI system could be built to learn and improve itself indefinitely has acquired the label of the bootstrap fallacy. Attempts in AI to implement such a system have met with consistent failure for half a century. Technological optimists, however, have maintained that a such system is possible, producing, if implemented, a feedback loop that would lead to a rapid exponential increase in intelligence. We examine the arguments for both positions and draw some conclusions. }} [http://mol-eng.com/bootstrap.pdf Self-archive]</ref>

It turns out that the supposedly characteristic features of “new AI” (embodiment, situatedness, absence of reasoning, and absence of representation) are all present in conventional systems: “New AI” is just like old AI. Brooks proposal boils down to the architectural rejection of central control in intelligent agents—Which, however, turns out to be crucial. Some of more recent cognitive science suggests that we might do well to dispose of the image of intelligent agents as central representation processors. If this paradigm shift is achieved, Brooks’ proposal for cognition without representation appears promising for full-blown intelligent agents—Though not for conscious agents.}} [http://www.typos.de/pdf/2007_AI_without_representation_M&amp;M.pdf Self-archive]</ref>

To move artificial systems closer to such general-purpose intelligence we cannot avoid replicating some subset—quite possibly a substantial portion—of this large set. Progress in this direction requires that systems integration be taken more seriously as a fundamental research problem. In this paper I make the argument that intelligence must be studied holistically. I present key issues that must be addressed in the area of integration and propose solutions for speeding up rate of progress towards more powerful, integrated A.I. systems, including (a) tools for building large, complex architectures, (b) a design methodology for building realtime A.I. systems and (c) methods for facilitating code sharing at the community level. }}</ref>

You can survive in diaries, photographs, sound recordings, and movies. But these artifacts record only superficial features of yourself. We are already close to the construction of programs that partially and approximately replicate entire human lives (by storing their memories and duplicating their personalities). A digital ghost is an artificially intelligent program that knows all about your life. It is an animated auto-biography. It replicates your patterns of belief and desire. You can survive after death in a digital ghost. We discuss a series of digital ghosts over the next 50 years. As time goes by and technology advances, they are progressively more perfect replicas of the lives of their original authors. }}</ref>

Alternatively, they fail to state it suitably for the lesser-informed public eye. The author does not claim to be able to remedy this.

Admirably, Paul Thagard has attempted to give a computationally detailed account of the kind of coherence involved in practical reasoning, claiming that it will help overcome problems in foundationalist approaches to ethics. The arguments herein rebut the alleged role of coherence in practical reasoning endorsed by Thagard. While there are some general lessons to be learned from the preceding, no attempt is made to argue against all forms of coherence in all contexts. Nor is the usefulness of computational modelling called into question. The point will be that coherence cannot be as useful in understanding moral reasoning as coherentists may think. This result has clear implications for the future of Machine Ethics, a newly emerging subfield of AI. }}</ref>

[[File:AIBO.JPG|thumb|right|The AIBO ERS-7]]'''AIBO''' ('''A'''rtificial '''I'''ntelligence ro'''BO'''t, homonymous with "pal" or "partner" in Japanese) was one of several types of [[robot]]ic [[pet]]s designed and manufactured by [[Sony]]; there have been several different models since their introduction on May 11, 1999. AIBO was discontinued in 2006.

==Overview==
Being able to walk, "see" its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands in Spanish and English; AIBO robotic pets are considered to be [[autonomous robot]]s since they are able to learn and mature based on external stimuli from their owner or environment, or from other AIBOs. Artist [[Hajime Sorayama]] created the initial designs for the AIBO.

The original designs are part of the permanent collections of MoMA and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  The design won Sony and artist Sorayama the highest design award that may be conferred by Japan. On January 26, 2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products as of March, 2006 in Sony's effort to make the company more profitable. It also stopped development of the [[QRIO]] robot. AIBO will still be supported until 2013 (ERS7 model) and AIBO technology will continue to be developed for use in other consumer products.<ref> [http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/info/presen/05q3/qfhh7c000008adfe.html] [http://www.jp.aibo.com/support/clinic_info/notice_58.html]</ref>
[[File:AiboKids.jpg|thumb|left|AIBO playing with children]]
AIBOware (the name is a trademark of Sony corporation), is the title given to the [[software]] the AIBO runs on its pink [[Memory Stick]]. The ''Life'' AIBOware allows the robot to be raised from pup to fully grown adult while going through various stages of development as its owner interacts with it. The ''Explorer'' AIBOware allows the owner to interact with a fully mature robot able to understand (though not necessarily willing to obey) 100 voice commands. Without the AIBOware, the AIBO will run in what is called "clinic mode" and can only perform basic actions.

Many AIBO owners enjoy teaching their pets new behaviors by reprogramming them (in Sony's special 'R-CODE' language). However, in October 2001, Sony sent a cease-and-desist notice to the webmaster of Aibopet, demanding that he stop distributing code that was retrieved by bypassing the [[copy protection]] mechanisms of the robot.  Eventually, in the face of many outraged AIBO owners, Sony released a programmer's kit for 'non-commercial' use.  The kit has now been expanded into three distinct tools:  R-CODE, AIBO Remote Framework, and the OPEN-R SDK.  These three tools are combined under the name AIBO Software Development Environment.  All of these tools are free to download and can be used for commercial or non-commercial use (Except for the OPEN-R SDK, which is specifically for non-commercial use). Since the first release of OPEN-R, several AIBO programming tools have been developed by university labs, including URBI <ref>[http://www.urbiforge.com/ URBI]</ref>, Tekkotsu <ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tekkotsu/ Tekkotsu]</ref>, Pyro<ref>[http://pyrorobotics.org/ Pyro]</ref> and AiBO+<ref>[http://aiboplus.sourceforge.net AiBO+ home page]</ref>. The Open-R and gcc based toolchain has been updated by the community to use gcc 4.1.2, binutils 2.17 and newlib 2.15. The packaged version of the old and updated Aibo toolchain is available for Ubuntu in a PPA<ref>[http://launchpad.net/~csaba-kertesz/+archive/aiboplus Ubuntu PPA with Aibo toolchain]</ref>.

AIBO's complete vision system uses the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] algorithm, to recognise its charging station. The newest versions are equipped with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection, allowing them to send the pictures they take via email which led to the [[Roblog]].

AIBO's sounds were programmed by Japanese DJ/avant-garde composer [[Nobukazu Takemura]], fusing mechanic and organic concepts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The bodies of the "3x" series (Latte and Macaron, the round-headed AIBOs released in 2001) were designed by visual artist [[Katsura Moshino]].

==RoboCup==

The AIBO has seen use as an inexpensive platform for [[artificial intelligence]] research, because it integrates a computer, vision system, and articulators in a package vastly cheaper than conventional research robots. The [[RoboCup]] autonomous [[soccer]] [[:Category:Robotics competitions|competition]] had a "RoboCup Four-Legged Robot Soccer League" in which numerous institutions from around the world would participate. Competitors would [[Computer program|program]] a team of AIBO robots to play games of autonomous robot soccer against other competing teams.  The Four-Legged League ran from 1999 to 2008, although in the final year, many big-name universities did not compete as they had moved to the new NAO platform.  The University of New South Wales <ref>[http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~robocup/2010site/]</ref> was the most successful team in the League, making the final six times and winning three times.

==International AIBO Convention==
The International AIBO Convention takes place every year at Sony Robotics Tower in the Shinjuku prefecture. The first convention took place in 1999, on May 15. It was then set to May 2 to May 4. The 2009 convention, being in its tenth year, set attendance records. The convention usually features AIBO advertisements, free posters, free accessories, freeware/open-source downloads, an acoustic performance from best friends Mark Linn-Baker and Larry Sweeney, and "AIBO Shows".

<title>AJAX.OOP</title>
<text>{{Notability|date=November 2009}}
{{Primary sources|date=November 2009}}
{{Portal|Free software}}
'''AJAX.OOP''' is an [[open source]] [[JavaScript]] framework distributed under [[MIT License]]. Providing with [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]]-style coding engine and [[AJAX]] requests handling functionality to create [[web2.0]] components. Due to OOP paradigm AJAX.OOP library can be easily extended with additional functionality or used as core for other projects.

==The JavaScript OOP Library==

AJAX.OOP is a fast and scalable JavaScript Library for creating JavaScript/AJAX components in an object oriented way.

Main feature - strong [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]] paradigm implementation.AJAX.OOP engine allows the programmer to:

* Create classes with object-like defining syntax
* Inherit classes (both AJAX.OOP-style defined and created with native JavaScript code)
* Aggregate classes (including aggregation of self and parent class with special operators this.$_self and this.$_super)
* Define constructors as they are (name = 'constructor')
* Override parent class properties and methods (but call parent if you need by using special access operator this.$super)
* Access/call any parent properties and/or methods from any method of child class (just use this.$super accessor whenever you need to access parent properties and methods)
* Use strict defined objects with workable 'instanceof' operator on them when instantiating an exemplar of AJAX.OOP classes

<title>AKARI Project</title>
<text>The '''AKARI Architecture Design Project''' ('''AKARI Project''') is a large project for designing New Generation Network Architecture and is supported by the [[National Institute of Information and Communications Technology]] (NICT) of Japan. The name comes from the Japanese word '''AKARI''', which means "A small light (in the dark pointing to the future)". Launched in May 2006, the AKARI Project aims to build technologies for new generation network by 2015, developing a network architecture and creating a network design based on that architecture. AKARI is also denoted as a [[Future Internet]] project.

The members of the AKARI Project come from NICT and some other famous universities or companies such as [[Tokyo University]], [[Keio University]], [[Osaka University]], [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and NTT etc. So far they have produced a Conceptual Design Book, which describes their philosophy to pursue an ideal solution by researching new network architectures from a clean slate without being impeded by existing constraints. They have identified three major design principles as: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), Sustainable and Evolutionary, and Reality Connection. 

To some extent, the AKARI Project is similar to the [[Global Environment for Network Innovations]] ('''GENI''') facility of USA and the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) of EU. As a matter of fact, there are strong relationships among all these projects.

<title>ALCOR</title>
<text>'''ALCOR''' is an early computer language definition created by the '''ALCOR Group''', a consortium of universitites, research institutions and manufacturers in Europe and the USA which was founded in 1959 and which had 60 members in 1966. The group had the aim of a common [[compiler]] specification for a subset of [[ALGOL 60]] after the ALGOL meeting in Copenhagen in 1958.  ALCOR is an acronym, from '''AL'''GOL '''Co'''nverte'''r'''.

In Europe, a high level machine architecture for [[ALGOL 60]] was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the [[IBM 7090]]. An ALGOL manual was published which provided a detailed introduction of all features of the language with many program snippets, and four appendixes:{{SpecialChars

<title>ALGO</title>
<text>'''ALGO''' is an [[algebra]]ic [[programming language]] developed between 1959 and 1961 for the [[Bendix G-15]] [[computer]].

ALGO was one of several programming languages inspired by the ''Preliminary Report on the International Algorithmic Language'' written in Zürich in 1958. This report underwent several modifications before becoming the Revised Report on which most ALGOL implementations are based. As a result, ALGO and other early "ALGOLs" have a very different syntax from [[ALGOL 60]].

Other languages developed from the Zürich report include [[BALGOL]], [[MAD programming language|MAD]] (Michigan Algorithm Decoder) and [[NELIAC]].

==Example==
Here is the [[Trabb Pardo-Knuth algorithm]] in ALGO:

<pre>
1. TITLE TRABB PARDO-KNUTH ALGORITHM
2. SUBSCript I,J
3. DATA A(11)
4. FORMAt FI(2DT), FLARGE(3D)
5. PROCEdure F(T=Z)
6. BEGIN
7. Z=SQRT(ABS(T))+5*T^3
8. END
9. FOR I=0(1)10
10. A[I]=KEYBD
11. FOR J=0(1)10 BEGIN
11. I=J-10
12. F(A[I]=Y)
13. PRINT(FI)=I
14. IF Y &amp;gt; 400
15. GO TO LARGE
16. PRINT(FL)=Y
17. GO TO NEXT
18. LARGE: PRINT(FLARGE)=999
19. NEXT: CARR(1) END
20. END
</pre>

===Remarks===
* 1. A title is the only type of comment allowed. Line numbers were inserted by the editor.
* 2. Integer data type. The lower-case letters are not typos, but reflect the way in which ALGO code was presented in the original documentation.
* 3. Only the size of an array can be specified, lower bound is always zero.
* 4. The first format calls for a two-digit number followed by a tab, the second for a three digit number.
* 5. The syntax of ALGO's procedure implementations is slightly different from that given in the Zurich report. Functions as defined by the Zürich report are not implemented.
* 9. The syntax here is from the Zürich report and is also consistent with various 1950s-era autocodes.
* 10. KEYBD reads a numeric value from the terminal.

'''ALGOL 60''' (short for '''ALGO'''rithmic '''L'''anguage 1960) The name [[ALGOL]] of the family is sometimes given in mixed case ([http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm ''Algol 60'']), and sometimes in all uppercase ([http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/language/other/a68rr/rrtoc.htm ''ALGOL 68'']). Gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Simula]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and many others. [[ALGOL 58]] introduced code blocks and the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> pairs for delimiting them.  ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]]. 

[[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[ALGOL W]] on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the [[ALGOL 68]] committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published.

Note: [[ALGOL 68]] is substantially different from Algol 60 but was not well received so that in general "Algol" means dialects of Algol 60.

==Standardization==
ALGOL 60 - with [[COBOL]] - were the first languages to seek standardization.
* ISO 1538:1984, Programming language Algol 60 (now withdrawn)
* ISO TR 1672:1977, Algol 60 Hardware Representation (now withdrawn)

==History==
ALGOL 60 was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.

[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus–Naur Form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus–Naur Form]].<ref>Knuth, Donald E. (1964) Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form. Communications of the ACM 7(12):735-736</ref>

Peter Naur: "As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959. In this capacity I was the editor of the ALGOL 60 report, produced as the result of the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris in January 1960."<ref name="naur_acm">[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1024454&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=140&amp;ao=AMTURING&amp;yr=2005 ACM Award Citation / Peter Naur], 2005</ref>

The following people attended the meeting in Paris (from January 1 to 16):
* [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], [[Peter Naur]], [[Heinz Rutishauser]], [[Klaus Samelson]], [[Bernard Vauquois]], [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], and [[Michael Woodger]] (from Europe)
* [[John Backus|John W. Backus]], [[Julien Green (computer scientist)|Julien Green]], [[Charles Katz]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Alan Perlis|Alan J. Perlis]], and [[Joseph Henry Wegstein]] (from the USA).
Alan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: "The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent."

Both John Backus and Peter Naur served on the committee which created ALGOL 60 as did [[Wally Feurzeig]], who later created [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]].

ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[C. A. R. Hoare]] remarked: "Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors."<ref>[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf "Hints on Programming Language Design"], C.A.R. Hoare, December 1973. Page 27. (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], also involved in implementing the first ALGOL 60 [[compiler]].)</ref>  The [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language, a variant of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of ALGOL, also adopted the wording "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme" for its standards documents in homage to ALGOL.<ref name="r3rs">{{cite web

==Properties==
ALGOL 60 as officially defined had no I/O facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (ALGOL 68 parlance for Input/Output) facilities.

ALGOL 60 allowed for two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common call-by-value, and call-by-name. Call-by-name had certain limitations in contrast to call-by-reference, making it an undesirable feature in imperative language design. For example, it is impossible in ALGOL 60 to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.<ref>

However, call-by-name is still beloved of ALGOL implementors for the interesting "[[thunk]]s" that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the "[[man or boy test]]" to separate compilers that correctly implemented "recursion and non-local references." This test contains an example of call-by-name.

==Examples and portability issues==
===Code sample comparisons===
====ALGOL 60====
(The way the bold text has to be written depends on the implementation, e.g. 'INTEGER' (including the quotation marks) for '''integer'''; this is known as [[stropping (syntax)|stropping]].)

 '''procedure''' Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);
     '''value''' n, m; '''array''' a; '''integer''' n, m, i, k; '''real''' y;
 '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m 
 is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;
 '''begin''' '''integer''' p, q;
     y := 0; i := k := 1;
     '''for''' p:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' n '''do'''
     '''for''' q:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' m '''do'''
         '''if''' abs(a[p, q]) &amp;gt; y '''then'''
             '''begin''' y := abs(a[p, q]);
             i := p; k := q
             '''end'''
 '''end''' Absmax

Here's an example of how to produce a table using Elliott 803 ALGOL.<ref>[http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ "803 ALGOL"], the manual for Elliott 803 ALGOL</ref>

  FLOATING POINT ALGOL TEST'
  BEGIN REAL A,B,C,D'
 
  READ D'
 
  FOR A:= 0.0 STEP D UNTIL 6.3 DO
  BEGIN
    PRINT PUNCH(3),££L??'
    B := SIN(A)'
    C := COS(A)'
    PRINT PUNCH(3),SAMELINE,ALIGNED(1,6),A,B,C'
  END'
  END'

PUNCH(3) sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch.<br/>
SAMELINE suppresses the carriage return + line feed normally printed between arguments.<br/>
ALIGNED(1,6) controls the format of the output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point

====ALGOL 60 family====
Since ALGOL 60 had no I/O facilities, there is no portable [[hello world program]] in ALGOL.  The following program could (and still will) compile and run on an ALGOL implementation for a Unisys A-Series mainframe, and is a straightforward simplification of code taken from [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/index.html The Language Guide] at the [[University of Michigan]]-Dearborn Computer and Information
Science Department [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/algol/hworld.html Hello world! ALGOL Example Program page].

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   EBCDIC ARRAY E[0:11];
   REPLACE E BY "HELLO WORLD!";
   WRITE(F, *, E);
 END.

A simpler program using an inline format:

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   WRITE(F, &amp;lt;"HELLO WORLD!"&amp;gt;);
 END.

An even simpler program using the Display statement:

 BEGIN DISPLAY("HELLO WORLD!") END.

An alternative example, using Elliott Algol I/O is as follows.  Elliott Algol used different characters for "open-string-quote" and "close-string-quote", represented here by ‘ and ’.

  '''program''' HiFolks;
  '''begin'''
     '''print''' ‘Hello world’;
  '''end''';

Here's a version for the Elliott 803 Algol (A104) The standard Elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case.  The code lacked any quote characters so £ (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote.  Special sequences were placed in double quotes (e.g. ££L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter).   

   HIFOLKS'
   BEGIN
      PRINT £HELLO WORLD£L??'
   END'

The [[ICT 1900]] Algol I/O version allowed input from paper tape or punched card.  Paper tape 'full' mode allowed lower case.  Output was to a line printer.
   'PROGRAM' (HELLO)
   'BEGIN'
      'COMMENT' OPEN QUOTE IS '(', CLOSE IS ')', PRINTABLE SPACE HAS TO
                BE WRITTEN AS % BECAUSE SPACES ARE IGNORED;
      WRITE TEXT('('HELLO%WORLD')');
   'END'
   'FINISH'

<text>'''ALGOL 68S'''<ref name="SIGPLAN">''A Sublanguage of ALGOL 68'', P.G. Hibbard, SIGPLAN Notices 12(5), May 1977</ref> was designed as a subset of [[ALGOL 68]] in order to permit single-pass compilation. It was mostly for numerical computation.

==Implementations==
A compiler for ALGOL 68S was available for the [[PDP-11]], written in [[BLISS (programming language)|BLISS]]. The multiprocessor version designed for the [[C.mmp]]<ref name="Cmmp">[http://vestein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt] Description of C.mmp A68S implementation.</ref> has been preserved at the [[PUPS]] archive of the PDP11 Unix Heritage society, c.f. [http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Applications/algol68.tar.gz].

[[Charles H. Lindsey]] has another ALGOL 68 implementation called ALGOL 68S for [[Sun3]], Sun [[Sparc]] (under [[SunOS]] 4.1), Sun Sparc (under [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 2), [[Atari ST]] (under [[Atari ST|GEMDOS]]) and [[Acorn Archimedes]] (under [[RISCOS]]), c.f. [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl#ALGOL%2068]

==Chief differences from ALGOL 68==
* no '''union'''
* no '''flex''' but '''string'''s are handled specially
* no arrays inside structures (but references to arrays would be allowed) and a similar restriction on arrays of arrays (multidimensional arrays are nonetheless permitted)
* limitations on use of '''long''' and '''short''' to facilitate implementation on small computers
* no '''heap'''
* no parallel processing
* restrictions on the order of declaration and other small syntactic differences to make single pass compilation possible
* no '''format'''s

<title>ALGOL Y</title>
<text>'''ALGOL Y''' was the name given to a speculated successor for the [[ALGOL 60 programming language]] that incorporated some radical features that were rejected for [[ALGOL 68]] and [[ALGOL X]]. ALGOL Y was intended to be a "radical reconstruction" of ALGOL.

One such feature was the possibility to construct new <code>proc mode</code>'s at [[run-time]], which was criticized as the ability to ''modify its own programs at run time'' while, on the other hand, it would have brought ALGOL Y to the same level of expressiveness as [[LISP]].

</ref>.
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], [[David Gay]] and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL does not solve problems directly; instead, it calls appropriate external [[solver]]s (such as [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[MINOS (solver)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and so on) to obtain solutions. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl files]].

One particular advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the NEOS <ref name="neos">http://www-neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/</ref> server hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Availability==

AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows]].
It is a proprietary software currently maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However there exist several online services <ref name="neos"/><ref>http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/</ref> providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL. Also a free student version with limited functionality is available <ref>http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html</ref>.

==Optimization problems supported==

AMPL handles a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory|Complementarity problems]] (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables

<title>AMSRefs</title>
<text>{{orphan|date=April 2010}}

The '''AMSRefs''' package is an extension package for [[LaTeX]] that facilitates the creation of [[bibliography|bibliographies]] and [[citation]]s in LaTeX documents. Use of AMSRefs allows for the retention of rich [[markup language|markup]] that makes references easier to reuse in other publishing environments, such as on the [[Internet|Web]], in other book or journal formats, or with citation services. The package is available for free on the [[American Mathematical Society]]'s website.

The purpose of AMSRefs is to provide a simpler, more flexible way to use many of the bibliography and citation features that users of LaTeX and [[BibTeX]] have come to expect. AMSRefs has been designed to encourage the preservation of structured markup of the
bibliography throughout the entire lifetime of a document, from rough draft to final archival version. It does this by replacing the unstructured [[.bbl]] file format of LaTeX by a fully structured format. The package is compatible with the “showkeys”, “hyperref”, and “backrefs” packages and implements the functionality of the “cite” package. AMSRefs provides that the bibliography style is controlled completely through LaTeX instead of being determined partly by a BibTeX style file and partly through LaTeX. The same data format is used in the database file and in the LaTeX document. Thus an AMSRefs-format database is a valid LaTeX document that can be printed directly.  Also, an author can send an article with embedded references to a publisher without any loss of internal structural information about the entries. It is possible to use the AMSRefs package without abandoning one’s existing BibTeX database files.

==Locations==

Two (DPC 1 and DPC 2) were installed at SAC headquarters (Bldg 500) at [[Offutt Air Force Base]] outside [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. One (DPC 3) was installed in the Headquarters 15th Air Force Combat Operations Center at [[March Air Force Base]], near [[Riverside, California]]. Another machine, designated the [[AN/FSQ-32]], was installed at [[System Development Corporation]] (SDC) headquarters, [[Santa Monica, California]] and was used as a development machine for the compiler and operational software for the '''Q-31'''s.

===Architecture===

The system was divided into functional sections:
:# [[Central Processing Unit]]
:# Memory
:# High-Speed Input/Output
:# Low-Speed Input/Output
:# Operations Console

====Central Processing Unit====

Memory was addressed by words, which were 48 [[bit]]s long. Each half word (24 bits) had a parity bit, for a total storage size of 50 bits. Depending on addressing mode, each word could be viewed as either 1 48-bit word, 2-24 bit half-words, 6 8-bit characters ([[EBCDIC]] encoded) or 8 6-bit bytes. A 6-bit byte, as opposed to the 8-bit [[byte]] in common use today, was common in IBM and other scientific computers of the time. The address space provided a maximum of 256K words.

The [[Instruction set|ISA]] was rather complicated for its time. The instructions were a fixed length of one word providing 24 bits for the operation and 24 bits for the address. The address consisted of 18 bits (3 bytes) for the memory address, with other bits used for the specification of index registers and indirect addressing.

The operation field provided the operation code and a variety of modifiers. Some modifiers allowed instructions to operate only on specific bytes of a word or on specific bits of a byte without separate masking operations. Other modifiers allowed the single 48-bit [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] to operate on a pair of 24-bit operands to facilitate vector operations.

Other parts of the CPU were some sense switches, which could be used to control various software functions, the run/halt switch, and a switch, amplifier, and speaker assembly, which could be used to provide audio feedback or even play music, by
connecting one of four bits in the main accumulator which could then be toggled under software control at an appropriate rate to produce whatever tones one wanted. Someone in the software development division had produced a card deck on which was stored an executive that allowed selecting from a whole list of songs, including Christmas Carols, by setting the sense switches to a particular code, which would be printed out on the I/O Typewriter if a certain sense switch was on when the program was started.

====Memory====

The '''Q-31'''s were equipped with four 16 [[word (computing)|kiloword]] memory banks. The memory bank was oil and water cooled. Also considered as part of the memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were four 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a [[plugboard]], similar to the one used in [[IBM]] [[unit record equipment]], that had the capacity of 32 [[word (computing)|word]]s, so longer [[bootstrap]] or diagnostic programs could be installed in plug panels which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used. This served as a primitive [[Read-Only Memory|ROM]].

====High-Speed Input/Output====

The High-Speed I/O section provided interfaces to the Drum Memory system, which consisted of a control system, and two vertical drum memory devices. Each drum read and wrote 50 bits at a time in parallel so transferring data could be done quickly. The drums were organized as 17 fields with 8192 words per field for a total capacity of 139264 words. The motors that rotated the drums required 208 VAC at 45 Hz so a motor generator unit was required to change the frequency from 60 Hz. This added to the noise level in the computer room.

====Low-Speed Input/Output====

The Low-Speed I/O section interfaced to several different devices:
:* [[SACCS EDTCC]], which then interfaced to the rest of the [[SAC Automated Command and Control|SACCS]] system.
:* Tape Controllers 1 and 2, connected to 16 [[IBM 729]]-V Tape Drives
:* Disk File Controller, which was a modified Tape Controller, connected to the
:** Bryant PH 2000 Disk File, which had 24 disks that were 39 inches in diameter, 125 read/write heads that were hydraulically actuated, and had a total capacity of 26 [[megabyte|MB]]
:* [[IBM 1401]], which controlled data transfers from unit-record equipment:
:** [[IBM 1402]] Card Reader/Punch
:** [[IBM 1403]] Line Printer
:** 2 [[IBM 729]]-V Tape Drives
:* 2 [[IBM Selectric]] Typewriters, (I/O Typewriters) one of which was used for operational messages and the other for diagnostic messages and maintenance activities.

<!--
The computers were part of the SAC command and control system. SDC developed the system software using [[JOVIAL]] (Jules Own Version of the International Algebraic Language), one of the first high level complied programming languages.

<title>ANIMAL (image processing)</title>
<text>'''ANIMAL''' (first implementation: 1988 - revised: 2004) is an interactive environment for [[Image processing]] that is oriented toward the rapid prototyping, testing, and modification of algorithms. To create ANIMAL (AN IMage ALgebra), [[XLISP]] of David Betz was extended with some new types: sockets, arrays, images, masks, and drawables.
The theoretical framework and the implementation of the working environment is described in the paper [http://tev.fbk.eu/people/modena/Papers/BruMod_AF_1989.pdf ANIMAL: AN IMage ALgebra]<ref>R. Brunelli and C. M. Modena, "ANIMAL: AN IMage ALgebra", High Frequency, 1989, LVIII:3:255-259</ref>.

In the theoretical framework of ANIMAL a [[digital image]] is a boundless matrix with its ''history''. However, in the implementation it is bounded by a rectangular region in the discrete plane and the elements outside the region have a constant value. The size and position of the region in the plane (focus) is defined by the coordinates of the rectangle. In this way all the [[pixel]]s, including those on the border, have the same number of neighbors (useful in local operators, such as [[digital filter]]s). Furthermore, pixelwise [[commutative operation]]s 
remain commutative on image level, independently on focus (size and position of the rectangular regions). The ''history'' is a list which tracks the operations and parameters applied to the matrix. This mechanism is useful to document algorithms and generate new functions.

ANIMAL has been ported to [[R (programming language)|R]], a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
[http://tev.fbk.eu/TM/AnImAl.tgz  The new implementation]   is free  and is used in a recent book<ref>R. Brunelli, ''Template Matching Techniques in Computer Vision: Theory and Practice'', Wiley, ISBN 978-0-470-51706-2, 2009 ''([http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470517069.html] TM book)''</ref>  to illustrate the use of template matching techniques in computer vision  (see the [http://tev.fbk.eu/TM/html/tmCodeCompanionli2.html#x3-2000 preface] of the [http://tev.fbk.eu/TM/html book code companion]).

<title>ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis</title>
<text>{{multiple issues|context=November 2010|wikify=November 2010|onesource=November 2010}}

'''ASCA''', '''ANOVA-SCA''', or '''analysis of variance – simultaneous component analysis''' is a method that partitions variation and enables interpretation of these partitions by SCA, a method that is similar to [[Principal components analysis|PCA]]. This method is a multi or even megavariate extension of [[ANOVA]]. The variation partitioning is similar to Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Each partition matches all variation induced by an effect or factor, usually a treatment regime or experimental condition. The calculated effect partitions are called effect estimates. Because even the effect estimates are multivariate, interpretation of these effects estimates is not intuitive. By applying SCA on the effect estimates one gets a simple interpretable result. In case of more than one effect this method estimates the effects in such a way that the different effects are not correlated. See also references ([http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti476], [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cem.952] and [http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-322]).

== Details ==

Many research areas see increasingly large numbers of variables in only few samples. The low sample to variable ratio creates problems known as [[multicollinearity]] and singularity. Because of this, most traditional multivariate statistical methods cannot be applied.

== ASCA algorithm ==

This section details how to calculate the ASCA model on a case of two main effects with one interaction effect. It is easy to extend the declared rationale to more main effects and more interaction effects. If the first effect is time and the second effect is dosage, only the interaction between time and dosage exist. 
We assume there are four time points and three dosage levels. 

Let X be a matrix that holds the data. X is mean centered, thus having zero mean columns. A1, A2, A3 and A4, as B1, B2 and B3 indicate the levels in time and dosage. A and B are required to be balanced if the effect estimates need to be orthogonal and the partitioning unique. Matrix E holds the information that is not assigned to any effect. The partitioning gives the following notation:

: <math>X = A+B+AB+E \,</math>

== Calculating main effect estimate A (or B) ==

Find all rows that correspond to effect A level 1 and averages these rows. The result is a vector. Repeat this for the other effect levels. Make a new matrix of the same size of X and place the calculated averages in the matching rows. That is, give all rows that match effect (i.e.) A level 1 the average of effect A level 1. 
After completing the level estimates for the effect, perform an SCA. The scores of this SCA are the sample deviations for the effect, the important variables of this effect are in the weights of the SCA loading vector.

== Calculating interaction effect estimate AB ==

Estimating the interaction effect is similar to estimating main effects. The difference is that for interaction estimates the rows that match effect A level 1 are combined with the effect B level 1 and all combinations of effects and levels are cycled through. In our example setting, with four time point and three dosage levels there are 12 interaction sets {A1-B1, A1B2, A2B1, A2B2 and so on}. It is important to deflate (remove) the main effects before estimating the interaction effect.

== SCA on partitions A, B and AB ==

Simultaneous component analysis is mathematically identical to [[Principal components analysis|PCA]], but is semantically different in that it models different objects or subjects at the same time. 
The standard notation for a SCA – and PCA – model is:

: <math>X=TP^{'}+E \,</math>

where ''X'' is the data, ''T'' are the component scores and ''P'' are the component loadings. ''E'' is the residual or error matrix. Because ASCA models the variation partitions by SCA, the model for effect estimates looks like this:

: <math>A=T_{a}P_{a}^{'}+E_{a} \,</math>

: <math>B=T_{b}P_{b}^{'}+E_{b} \,</math>

: <math>AB=T_{ab}P_{ab}^{'}+E_{ab} \,</math>

: <math>E=T_{e}P_{e}^{'}+E_{e} \,</math>

Note that every partition has its own error matrix. However, algebra dictates that in a balanced mean centered data set every two level system is of rank one. This results in zero errors, since any rank 1 matrix can be written as the product of a single component score and loading vector.

The full ASCA model with two effects and interaction including the SCA looks like this:

Decomposition:

: <math>X=A+B+AB+E \,</math>

: <math>X=T_{a}P_{a}^{'}+T_{b}P_{b}^{'}+T_{ab}P_{ab}^{'}+T_{e}P_{e}^{'}+E_{a}+E_{b}+E_{ab}+E_{e}+E \,</math>

== Time as an Effect ==

Because 'time' is treated as a qualitative factor in the ANOVA decomposition preceding ASCA, a nonlinear multivariate time trajectory can be modeled. An example of this is shown in Figure 10 of this reference ([http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121356309/abstract]).

The '''ANSI/ISO C Specification Language '''('''ACSL''') is a specification language for [[C program]]s, using Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants, that follows the design by contract paradigm. Specifications are written as C annotation comments to the C program, which hence can be compiled with any C compiler.

The current verification tool for ACSL is [[Frama-C]].

== Overview ==

ACSL is a Behavioral Interface Specification Language (BISL). It aims at specifying behavioral properties of C source code. The main inspiration for this language comes from the specification language of the Caduceus tool for deductive verification of behavioral properties of [[C program]]s. The specification language of Caduceus is itself inspired from [[JML]] which aims at similar goals for Java source code.

One difference with [[JML]], is that ACSL aims at static verification and deductive verification whereas [[JML]] aims both at runtime assertion checking and static verification using for instance the [[ESC/Java]] tool.

== Syntax ==

Let us consider the following example for the prototype of a function named <code>incrstar</code>:

 /*@ requires \valid(p);
   @ assigns *p;
   @ ensures *p == \old(*p) + 1;
   @*/
 void incrstar (int *p);

The contract is given by the comment which starts with <code>/*@</code>. Its meaning is as follows:
* the first line is a precondition: it states that function <code>incrstar</code> must be called with a pointer <code>p</code> that points to a safely allocated memory location.
* Second line is a frame clause, stating that function <code>incrstar</code> does not modify any memory location but the one pointed to by <code>p</code>.
* Finally, the <code>ensures</code> clause is a postcondition, which specifies that the value <code>*p</code> is incremented by one.

== Tool support ==

Most of the features of ACSL are supported by [[Frama-C]].

<title>ANSI art</title>
<text>'''ANSI art''' is a computer artform that was widely used at one time on [[Bulletin board system|BBSes]]. It is similar to [[ASCII art]], but constructed from a larger set of 256 letters, numbers, and symbols &amp;mdash; all codes found in IBM [[code page 437]], often referred to as [[extended ASCII]] and used in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Unix]]<ref>http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/ascii/</ref> environments. ANSI art also contains special [[ANSI escape code|ANSI escape sequence]]s that color text with the 16 foreground and 8 background colours offered by [[ANSI.SYS]], an MS-DOS [[device driver]] loosely based upon the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] X3.64 standard for [[text terminal]]s. Some ANSI artists take advantage of the cursor control sequences within ANSI X3.64 in order to create animations, commonly referred to as ''[[ANSImation]]s''.  ANSI art and text files which incorporate ANSI codes carry the ''de facto'' <tt>.ANS</tt> [[filename extension|file extension]].
__TOC__
ANSI art is considerably more flexible than ASCII art, because the particular character set it uses contains symbols intended for drawing, such as a wide variety of box-drawing characters and block characters that [[dithering|dither]] the foreground and background color. It also adds accented characters and math symbols that often find creative use among ANSI artists.

The popularity of ANSI art encouraged the creation of a powerful shareware package called [[TheDraw]] coded by Ian E. Davis in 1986. Not only did it considerably simplify the process of making an ANSI art screen from scratch, but it also included a variety of "fonts", large letters constructed from box and block characters, and transition animations such as ''dissolve'' and ''clock''. No new versions of TheDraw emerged after version 4.63 in 1993, but in later years a number of other ANSI editors appeared, some of which are still maintained today.

The decline of both BBSes and DOS users has made it difficult for many users to even view ANSI animations. As a consequence, this form of art is no longer practiced to the degree it once was.

[[File:Zzt.png|thumb|right|250px|Entry ANSI art screen for [[ZZT]] ]]
The popular game creation system (GCS) ''[[ZZT]]'' used ANSI graphics exclusively. A later GCS based on the same concept, ''[[MegaZeux]]'', allowed users to modify the extended ASCII character set as well.

[[Trade Wars 2002]], a multiplayer BBS game that remains popular 20 years after its release in 1986, used ANSI graphics to depict ships, planets, and important locations, and included cutscenes and even a cinema with ANSI animations.  Many of these ANSI graphics were created by Drew Markham, who went on to form [[Xatrix]]/[[Gray Matter Interactive]] and develop ''[[Redneck Rampage]]'' and ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'', among other titles.

[[Dwarf Fortress]] is another game, first released in 2002, leveraging ANSI graphics. Dwarf Fortress' default graphics is exclusively ANSI [[code page 437]] characters.

In [[1987]] [[Amiga]] program ''Skyline BBS'' was the first BBS management program featuring an extension to ANSI Art as a true form of script [[markup language]] communication protocol. It was called [[Skypix]] and was capable to give the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.<ref name="Skyline">{{cite web | title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher = [[Jason_Scott_Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author = Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}}</ref>

'''AOL Radio powered by CBS Radio''', (formerly '''AOL Radio featuring XM'''), is an online [[radio]] service.

== History ==
AOL Radio can trace its roots to two companies it acquired on June 1, 1999, for $400 million: Spinner.com and Nullsoft.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,666492,00.html Nullsoft and Spinner acquisition announcement</ref>  Spinner.com was formerly known as TheDJ.com.  Nullsoft was the maker of the popular [[Winamp]] and [[SHOUTcast]] products.  Both new organizations operated out of the same office in [[San Francisco]].  The Spinner.com brand was retired in July 2003, but exists today as an AOL Music blog and a series of channels on AOL Radio.

AOL Radio launched as Radio@AOL, essentially a re-branded Spinner.com, using technology from [[Real Networks]] on October 16, 2001 as part of the AOL 7.0 software announced that same day.<ref>[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669020,00.html] AOL Radio Announcement</ref>

In its first month of operation, AOL reported that 2.2 million members accessed Radio@AOL, making it one of AOL's most popular features.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669108,00.html AOL Radio Launch Announcement</ref>

Initially, Radio@AOL was available only to AOL Members.  On May 22, 2002, AOL released the free Radio@Netscape for non-members<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669336,00.html Free AOL Radio Press Release</ref> as part of the new Netscape 7.0 browser.  On August 22, 2002, AOL released Radio@Netscape Plus.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669435,00.html  Radio@Netscape Plus announcement</ref>  Beginning in 2004, AOL started metering Radio@Netscape to allow only two hours of usage per day.  AOL did this to avoid paying copyright royalties and to encourage users to become AOL Members.<ref>http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=15639 AOL Metering Radio@Netscape article at The Inquirer</ref>

On 28 November 2007, AOL announced that they may shut down their web radio services after a 38 percent increase in royalties to air music. Yahoo! and AOL discontinued directing users to their radio sites after [[SoundExchange]], the non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on the behalf of sound recording copyright owners (SRCOs) and featured artists for non-interactive digital transmissions, began collecting the higher fees in July.<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a0pKOrcpw6yE&amp;refer=us Article concerning royalties issues</ref>

On April 30, 2008, XM and AOL Radio ended their partnership due to the change in Internet royalty rates.<ref>http://journals.aol.com/theradioblog/aolradio/entries/2008/04/30/aol-radio--xm-update-430/1681 04-30-2008 AOL Radio announces end of partnership with XM</ref> On June 10, 2008, a new AOL Radio player debuted with 150 streaming [[CBS Radio]] stations.

On February 4, 2010, AOL Radio banned users outside the U.S. from streaming online radio. An error message points to Last FM. "We're sorry, this station is unavailable from your current location. Instead, enjoy listening to...."<ref>http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/02/01/a-message-for-international-radio-listeners Announcement concerning international radio listeners</ref>

On November 18, 2002, AOL introduced Broadband Radio@AOL.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669580,00.html Broadband Radio@AOL Announcement</ref>  Broadband Radio@AOL was built into the AOL 8.0 software, and was the first AOL Radio offering based on the AOL streaming technology [[Ultravox (software)|Ultravox]].  By 2003, AOL had migrated most of its AOL Radio products to Ultravox.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669962,00.html Ultravox Technology press release</ref> It was released in the UK on October 20, 2003.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,670097,00.html UK Release Announcement</ref>

On April 11, 2005, AOL and [[XM Satellite Radio]] joined together to create Radio@AOL featuring XM.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1047989,00.html Radio@AOL featuring AM Announcement</ref>  At the same time, AOL consolidated Radio@AOL and Radio@Netscape as "Radio@AOL featuring XM."  This service was available to AOL members and non-members alike, with twenty XM channels offered (fifty more XM channels require a paying AOL subscription).  Later in 2005, AOL changed the name of Radio@AOL to AOL Radio to align itself with the AOL Music branding.  In July 2005, a web version of AOL Radio was introduced for non-members with unlimited listening.  At the end of 2005, Radio@Netscape was officially retired, with AOL Radio being the official brand.

On April 30, 2008, AOL and [[XM Satellite Radio]] announced the end of their partnership<ref>[http://journals.aol.com/theradioblog/aolradio/entries/2008/04/30/aol-radio--xm-update-430/1681 AOL Radio &amp; XM Update: 4/30<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the beginning of the new partnership between [[AOL]] and [[CBS Radio]]. The partnership between AOL and CBS Radio would give AOL access to over 150 of CBS Radio's terrestrial stations.

On June 10, 2008 the AOL CBS player for AIM was released. On June 11, 2008, the new AOL CBS Radio player for the web was released.

== Technology ==

AOL Radio powered by CBS Radio is supported on Adobe Flash 9 and is compatible with [[web browser]]s that support Flash 9 on [[Windows 2000]] through [[Windows Vista]] and [[Mac OS X]].

Listeners can connect to AOL Radio through the web, AOL Client, and AOL Radio for Mac. On July 10, 2008 AOL released a client for Apple's [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] via the [[App Store]] offering mobile streaming of all stations though WiFi, EDGE and 3G cellular connections. AOL Radio is now also available through the [[AOL Instant Messenger]] service, and [[Winamp]].

==Limits==

*Commercial breaks every hour
*There is no rewind, fast-forward, or playback.
*Local radio stations are limited to CBS affiliates
*There is no play-on-demand service
*No direct channel customization, though rating influences the songs played.
*Songs cannot be banned entirely, though giving them a 1-star rating will have them played very rarely.
*Banner ads, which cannot be blocked.
*A maximum of six skips per station per hour. Changing stations, refreshing the page, or reloading the player will use a skip.
*As of 2010, there is no premium subscription to remove the ads or skip limits.

<title>APC Smart-UPS</title>
<text>{{orphan|date=December 2008}}
The '''Smart-UPS''' is a series of enterprise-level [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]] (UPS) made by [[American Power Conversion]] (APC).<ref>[http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=165 APC - Smart-UPS - Product Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The units have a ''Smart Slot'' which accepts an optional interface card providing features ranging from network connectivity to temperature and humidity monitoring.<ref name="SmartSlot">[http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=98 APC - UPS Network Management Cards - Product Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  With the exception of the RT series, Smart-UPS units are [[Uninterruptible power supply#Line-interactive|line-interactive]] UPS systems, only running their inverters when grid power is unavailable.

All Smart-UPS units work with APC's PowerChute software which is available for a variety of OS'. Legacy Smart=UPS (Not SMX, SMT, or SURTD series) can also work with Network UPS Tools (NUT), a third party application, under Linux.<ref>[http://eu1.networkupstools.org/compat/stable.html Network UPS Tools: UPS hardware compatibility list (stable)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The software is designed to safely and automatically shut down any connected computers before the batteries are depleted.

== Models ==

There are a few different variations in the Smart-UPS lineup.

== Smart Slot ==

[[Image:Smartups-2200xlrm3u-inside.jpg|right|thumb|Inside a rack mountable '''Smart-UPS''' 2200XL]]

Most Smart-UPS units have at least one Smart Slot, with the larger (and in many cases older) models supporting two.  Installing an add-on card into the Smart Slot will provide the UPS with additional features, beyond the default serial or USB connectivity.<ref name="SmartSlot"/>  The base AP9617 card provides fairly advanced features, such as e-mail notification and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] monitoring, as well as allowing remote control of the UPS via a web browser or telnet (to remotely switch off the load, for example.)<ref>[http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP9617 UPS Network Management Card<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Smart Slot is powered by the battery even when the UPS is switched off, allowing the UPS to be remotely cold-started even in a power loss situation (providing the network infrastructure is still powered up and functioning.)  The card will also continue to work for a short while after the UPS has switched off due to a low battery condition.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

<title>APLX</title>
<text>'''APLX''' is a modern, second generation, [[cross-platform]] [[programming language dialect|dialect]] of the [[APL programming language]]. APLX is targeted at applications such as financial planning, market research, statistics, management information, and various kinds of scientific and engineering work. APLX is based on [[IBM]]'s [[APL (programming language)#APL2|APL2]], but includes a number of extensions. APLX is created by MicroAPL. Version 3 of APLX was released in April and May of 2005. It is available on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS]]. Though APLX keeps APL's extended character set, APLX is a bit more verbose, due to the prevalence of system functions with long names and the use of structured-control keywords. The use of explicit loops is a major deviation from earlier versions of APL, as well as other APL derivatives.

<title>APL (codepage)</title>
<text>The '''APL''' [[code page]] is an [[EBCDIC]] based code page used specifically to write programs written in the [[APL (programming language)|APL]] programming language.

==Character set==
APL has always been criticized for its choice of a unique, non-standard character set. The observation that some who learn it usually become ardent adherents shows that there is some weight behind [[Kenneth E. Iverson|Iverson]]'s idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices which could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the [[IBM]] [[Selectric]] print mechanism along with a special APL type element. Over time, with the universal use of high-quality graphic display, printing devices and [[Unicode]] support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated; however, the problem of entering APL characters requires the use of [[input method editor]]s or special keyboard mappings, which may frustrate beginners accustomed to other languages.

From a user's standpoint, the additional characters can give APL a special elegance and concision not possible in other languages, using symbols visually mnemonic of the functions they represent.  On the other hand, it can lead to a ridiculous degree of complexity and unreadability, like when the symbols are strung together into a single mass without any comments.  It can be unreasonably difficult and time consuming to enter then later edit those APL statements.

All APL symbols are present in [[Unicode]], in the [[Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode)|Miscellaneous Technical]] range,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Unicode Standard 5.1 Code Charts: Techinical Symbols U+2300-U+23FF |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |work=Unicode Standard 5.1 |publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]] |date= }}</ref> although some APL products may not yet feature unicode, and some APL symbols may be unused or unavailable in a given vendor's implementation.

==Keyboard layout==
Note the mnemonics associating an APL character with a letter: ''question mark'' on ''Q'', ''power'' on ''P'', ''rho'' on ''R'', ''base value'' on ''B'', ''eNcode'' on ''N'', ''modulus'' on ''M'' and so on. This makes it easier for an English-language speaker to type APL on a non-APL keyboard providing one has visual feedback on one's screen. Also, decals have been produced for attachment to standard keyboards, either on the front of the keys or on the top of them.
:[[Image:APL-keybd2.svg|600px]]

A more up to date keyboard diagram, applicable for APL2 and other modern implementations, is available:  [http://www.users.on.net/~farnik/upload/APL2union.gif Union layout for windows].

Additional APL characters were available by [[Overstrike|overstriking]] one character over another.  For example, the ''log'' symbol was formed by overstriking shift-''P'' with shift-''O''.  This complicated correcting mistakes and editing program lines.  This may have ultimately been the reason for early APL programs to have a certain dense style - they were difficult to edit.

Many overstrikes, although appealing, are not actually used.  New overstrikes were introduced by vendors as they produced versions of APL tailored to specific hardware, system features, file system, and so on.  Further, printing terminals and early APL cathode-ray terminals were capable of displaying arbitrary overstrikes, but as personal computers rapidly replaced terminals as a data-entry device, APL character support was now provided as an ''APL Character Generator ROM'' or a soft character set rendered by the display device.  With the advent of Windows, APL characters were defined as just another complete font, thus the distinction between overstruck characters and standard characters having been eliminated.

Later IBM terminals, notably the [[IBM 3270]] display stations, had an alternate keyboard arrangement which is the basis for some of the modern APL keyboard layouts in use today.  Better terminals, namely display devices instead of printers, encouraged the development of better full screen editors, which had a measurable improvement in productivity and program readability.

In [[cryptography]], '''ARIA''' is a [[block cipher]] designed in 2003 by a large group of [[South Korea]]n researchers. In 2004, the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]] selected it as a standard cryptographic technique.

The algorithm uses a [[substitution-permutation network]] structure based on [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]. The interface is the same as AES: 128-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] with [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The number of rounds is 12, 14, or 16, depending on the key size. ARIA uses two 8&amp;times;8-bit [[substitution box|S-boxes]] and their inverses in alternate rounds; one of these is the [[Rijndael S-box]].

The [[key schedule]] processes the [[key (cryptography)|key]] using a 3-round 256-bit [[Feistel cipher]], with the binary expansion of 1/[[pi|''π'']] as a source of "[[nothing up my sleeve number]]s".

'''ARKive''' is a global initiative to locate and gather [[films]], [[photographs]] and [[sound|audio]] [[recordings]] of the world's [[species]] into one centralised [[digital]] [[library]] for the benefit of present and future [[generations]]. As such, it is sometimes described as the new [[Noah’s Ark]], or the Noah’s Ark of the online era.

==History==

[[Image:David Attenborough.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[David Attenborough]] and the ARKive]]
The project was launched in May [[2003]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}<!-- ARKive already had a publically visible website before 2000, the first HP-sponsored site re-launched at the 2000 Wildscreen Festival and a further site in 2002 --> by its patron, the [[UK]]-based natural history presenter, [[Sir David Attenborough]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,969572,00.html|publisher=''The Guardian''|title=Arkive sets sail on the web|accessdate=2007-07-02 | location=London | first=Ashley | last=Davies | date=2003-05-20}}</ref> a long-standing colleague and friend of its chief instigator, the late [[Christopher Parsons]], a former Head of the [[BBC Natural History Unit]].

Parsons identified a need to provide a centralised safe haven for wildlife films and photographs after discovering that many such records are held in scattered, non-indexed, collections, often with little or no public access, and sometimes in conditions that could lead to loss or damage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,839405,00.html|publisher=''The Guardian''|title=Christopher Parsons|accessdate=2007-07-02 | location=London | date=2002-11-14 | first=Barry | last=Paine}}</ref>
He believed the records could be a powerful force in building environmental awareness by bringing [[scientific]] names to life. He also saw their [[film preservation|preservation]] as an important educational resource and conservation tool, not least because extinction rates and habitat destruction could mean that images and sounds might be the only legacy of some species’ existence.

His vision of a permanent, accessible, refuge for audio-visual wildlife material won almost immediate support from many of the world’s major broadcasters; leading film and photographic libraries, international conservation organisations and academic institutes. 

Work on building ARKive began as part of the UK’s [[Millennium]] [[2000]] celebrations, using advanced computerised storage and retrieval technology devised for the project by [[Hewlett Packard]] Laboratories Europe. By the launch date, the project team had researched, catalogued, copied, described and authenticated image, sound and fact files of 1,000 [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[fungi]], many of them critically [[endangered]]. More multi-media profiles are added every month, starting with British [[flora]] and [[fauna]] and with species included on the [[Red List]] – that is, species that are believed to be closest to [[extinction]], according to research by the [[World Conservation Union]]. By January [[2006]], the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 still images and more than 50 hours of video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/pressReleases/suntimes010106.html|publisher=''ARKive''|title=ARKive named as Sunday Times website of the year|accessdate=2007-07-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609145850/http://www.arkive.org/pressReleases/suntimes010106.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-09}}</ref>.   

The ARKive project is an initiative of [[Wildscreen]], a UK-registered educational charity, based in [[Bristol]], and working globally to increase the public’s understanding and appreciation of biodiversity, through the power of wildlife imagery.

<title>ARM11</title>
<text>{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}
'''ARM11''' is an [[ARM architecture]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[microprocessor]] family which introduced the ARMv6 architectural additions. These include  [[SIMD]] media instructions, [[multiprocessor]] support and a new cache architecture.  The implementation included significantly improved instruction processing pipeline, compared to previous [[ARM9]] or [[ARM10]] families, and is used in [[smartphones]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nokia]], and others.  The initial ARM11 core (ARM1136) was released to licensees in late 2002.

The ARM11 family are currently the only ARMv6-architecture cores.  There are however Thumb2-only ARMv6-M cores (Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M1), addressing [[microcontroller]] applications; ARM11 cores target more demanding applications.

==Differences from ARM9==
In terms of instruction set, the ARM11 builds on the preceding [[ARM9]] generation.  It incorporates all ARM926EJ-S features and adds the ARMv6 instructions for media support (SIMD) and accelerating IRQ response.

Microarchitecture improvements in ARM11 cores<ref>"The ARM11 Microarchitecture", ARM Ltd, 2002</ref> include:

* SIMD instructions which can double [[MPEG-4]] and audio [[digital signal processing]] [[algorithm]] speed
* Cache is physically addressed, solving many cache aliasing problems and reducing context switch overhead
* Unaligned and mixed-endian data access is supported
* Reduced heat production and lower overheating risk
* Redesigned pipeline, supporting faster clock speeds (target up to 1 GHz)
** Longer: 8 stages vs 5
** Out-of-order completion
** Dynamic branch prediction/folding (like [[XScale]])
** Cache misses don't block execution of non-dependent instructions
** Load/Store parallelism
** [[arithmetic and logic unit|ALU]] parallelism
* [[64-bit]] data paths

[[JTAG]] debug support (for halting, stepping, breakpoints, and watchpoints) was simplified.  The EmbeddedICE module was replaced with an interface which became part of the ARMv7 architecture.  The hardware tracing modules (ETM and ETB) are compatible, but updated, versions of those used in the ARM9.  In particular, trace semantics were updated to address parallel instruction execution and data transfers.

Also of note was ARM's effort to promote good [[Verilog]] coding styles and techniques to ensure semantically rigorous designs, preserving identical semantics throughout the chip design flow, which included extensive use of [[formal verification]] techniques.  This is because ARM cores are integrated into many different designs, using a variety of [[logic synthesis]] tools and chip manufacturing processes, so the impact of its RTL quality is magnified many times<ref name="X">''The Dangers of Living with an X (bugs hidden in your Verilog)'', Version 1.1 (14th October, 2003).</ref>.  Without such attention, integrating an ARM11 with third party designs could risk exposing hard-to-find latent bugs.  (The ARM11 generation focussed more heavily on synthesis than previous generations, making such concerns be more of an issue.)

==ARM11 cores==
There are currently four ARM11 cores:

* ARM1136<ref name="arm1136">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0211k/DDI0211K_arm1136_r1p5_trm.pdf ARM1136JF-S and ARM1136J-S Technical Reference Manual] Revision: r1p5; ARM DDI 0211K</ref> (probably the most widely used core)
* ARM1156 introducing Thumb2 instructions
* ARM1176 introducing security extensions
* ARM11MPcore introducing multicore support

<title>ARM9</title>
<text>'''ARM9''' is an [[ARM architecture]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] family.  With this design generation, ARM moved from a [[von Neumann architecture]] (Princeton architecture) to a [[Harvard architecture]] with separate instruction and [[bus (computing)|data buses]] (and caches), significantly increasing its potential speed.  Most silicon chips integrating these cores will package them as [[modified Harvard architecture]] chips, combining the two address busses on the other side of separated [[CPU caches]] and tightly coupled memories.

There are two subfamilies, implementing different ARM architecture versions.

==Differences from ARM7 cores==
Key improvements over [[ARM7]] cores, enabled by spending more transistors, include<ref>"Performance of the ARM9TDMI and ARM9E-S cores compared to the ARM7TDMI core", Issue 1.0, dated 9 February 2000, ARM Ltd.</ref>:
* Decreased heat production and lower overheating risk.
* Clock frequency improvements.  Shifting from a three stage pipeline to a five stage one lets the clock speed be approximately doubled, on the same silicon fabrication process.
* Cycle count improvements.  Many unmodified ARM7 binaries were measured as taking about 30% fewer cycles to execute on ARM9 cores.  Key improvements include
** Faster loads and stores; many instructions now cost just one cycle.  This is helped by both the modified Harvard architecture (reducing bus and cache contention) and the new pipeline stages.
** Exposing pipeline interlocks, enabling compiler optimizations to reduce blockage between stages.
Additionally, some ARM9 cores incorporate "Enhanced DSP" instructions, such as a multiply-accumulate, to support more efficient implementations of [[digital signal processing]] algorithms.

Switching to a Harvard architecture entailed a non-unified cache, so that instruction fetches do not evict data (and vice versa).  ARM9 cores have separate data and address bus signals, which chip designers use in various ways.  In most cases they connect at least part of the address space in von Neumann style, used for both instructions and data, usually to an [[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture#Advanced_High-performance_Bus_.28AHB.29|AHB]] interconnect connecting to a [[DRAM]] interface and an [[External Bus Interface]] usable with [[NOR flash]] memory.  Such hybrids are no longer pure Harvard architecture processors.

==ARM9TDMI-based cores==
ARM9TDMI is a successor to the popular ARM7TDMI core, and is also based on the ARMv4T architecture.  Cores based on it support both 32-bit ARM and 16-bit Thumb instruction sets include:
* ARM920T with 16KB each of I/D cache and an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]
* ARM922T with 8KB each of I/D cache and an MMU
* ARM940T with cache and a Memory Protection Unit (MPU)

==ARM9E-based cores==
ARM9E, and its ARM9EJ sibling, implement longer pipelines and the ARMv5TE architecture, which includes some DSP-ish instruction set extensions.  They support 32-bit, 16-bit, and sometimes 8-bit instruction sets.
* ARM926EJ-S (includes ARM [[Jazelle]] technology which enables the direct execution of 8-bit [[Java bytecode]] in hardware), and an MMU

'''ART''' is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[image file format]] used mostly by the [[AOL|America Online]] (AOL) [[client (computing)|client]] [[software]]. The ART format ([[file extension]] ".art") holds a single still [[image]] that has been highly [[Image compression|compressed]]. Originally, the compression was developed by the [[Johnson-Grace|Johnson-Grace Company]], which was then acquired by the AOL [[Online service provider|service]].  When an image is converted to the ART format, the image is analyzed and the software decides what compression technique would be best.<ref>[http://www.webreference.com/dev/graphics/compress.html "Optimizing Web Graphics: Compression"]</ref> [[Internet Explorer]] used to be able to display ART images but now is no longer capable.

The AOL service can automatically convert images [[downloading|downloaded]] from the [[Internet]] to the compressed ART format. This conversion, which can be turned off, reduces download time for the image file. Image display problems with the AOL [[web browser]] are addressed at [http://web.archive.org/web/20071026143856/http://webmaster.info.aol.com/faq.html#graphics America Online webmaster FAQ entry]. An art file opened with AOL picture viewer can be saved as another file type. 

ART files can be batch converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPG]], and other file formats with rare graphics programs, such as Graphic Workshop Professional [http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gwspro.html] with an .art plug-in. Old versions of Internet Explorer can open and convert ART files to [[BMP file format|BMP]] files, through the File/[[Save As]] command.

'''ARX''' was a [[Mach-like]] [[operating system]] written in [[Modula-2+]] developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the Acorn Research Centre (ARC) and Software Technololgy Laboratory and later Olivetti Research Center (ORC, when Olivetti bought out Acorn) at [[Palo Alto]] for their new [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[RISC]] [[central processing unit|processors]] based [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] computers range. According to the project Application Manager <ref name="AppManagRCAc">[http://www.realworldtech.com/beta/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&amp;id=103093&amp;threadid=102990&amp;roomid=2 TOP3 smart moves]  Richard Cownie.

ARX was a pre-emptive [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]], multi-user operating system. Much of the OS ran in [[user mode]] and as a result suffered performance problems due to switches into [[kernel mode]] to perform [[mutex]]es, which led to the introduction of the SWP instruction to the instruction set of the ARM3 version of the ARM processor. It had support of optical ([[Write Once Read Many|WORM)]] disks file system <ref name="AppManagRCAc" /> and featured a window system, a window toolkit (and a direct manipulation [[User Interface]] editor<ref name="BTLTSARC">{{Cite web
| title = Brian T. Lewis - Resume

}}</ref>. This suggests that ARX had a [[microkernel]]-type design.

It was not finished in time to be fitted to the Acorn Archimedes range of computers, which shipped in 1987 with the [[Arthur (operating system)|Arthur]] operating system, derived from the earlier [[Acorn MOS|MOS]] operating system from Acorn's earlier [[8-bit]] [[BBC Micro]] range. Arthur was later superseded by [[RISC OS]].

The Acorn Research Centre was bought out by [[Olivetti]].

'''aRts''', which stands for '''a'''nalog '''R'''eal '''t'''ime '''s'''ynthesizer, is an audio framework that is no longer under development. It is most famous for previously being used in [[KDE]] (series [[KDE 2|2]] and [[KDE 3|3]]) to simulate an [[analog synthesizer]].

A key component of aRts is the [[sound server]] which mixes several [[streaming media|sound stream]]s in [[Real-time computing|realtime]]. The [[sound server]], called '''artsd''' (d for [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]), is also utilized as the standard sound server for KDE2–3. However, the sound server is not dependent on KDE and can be used in other projects. It is a direct competitor to [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]], another real-time sound server, and an indirect competitor to the [[Enlightened Sound Daemon]] (ESD). It is now common to use [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]]'s software mixing instead of artsd.

The '''aRts''' [[Platform (computing)|platform]] also includes aRts Builder — an [[application software|application]] for building custom layouts and configurations for audio mixers, sequencers, synthesizers and other audio [[schema]]{{dn}} via a user-friendly [[graphical user interface]]. aRts is [[free software]], distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

== End of project ==
On December 2, 2004 aRts' creator and primary developer Stefan Westerfeld announced he was leaving the project due to a variety of fundamental development and technical issues with aRts.

In KDE 4 developers chose to replace aRts with a new multimedia API known as [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]]<ref>[http://dot.kde.org/2006/04/27/phonon-multimedia-kde-4 “Phonon: Multimedia in KDE 4”], ''dot.kde.org'', 27 April 2006.</ref>. Phonon will provide a common interface on top of other systems, such as [[Xine]], to avoid being dependent on a single multimedia framework.

<title>AS2</title>
<text>{{for|ActionScript version 2 (programming language used with [[Adobe Flash]])|ActionScript}}


'''AS2''' (Applicability Statement 2) is a [[specification]] about how to transport data
securely and reliably over the [[Internet]]. Security is achieved by using [[digital certificate]]s and [[encryption]].

== AS2 Technical Overview ==

The AS2 protocol is based on [[HTTP]] and [[S/MIME]]. It was the second AS protocol developed and uses the same signing, encryption and [[Return_receipt#Message_Disposition_Notifications|MDN]] (as defined by [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3798.txt RFC3798]) conventions used in the original [[AS1_(networking)|AS1]] protocol. In other words:
* Files are encoded as "attachments" in a standardized [[S/MIME]] message (an AS2 message).
* AS2 messages are always sent using the [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]] protocol ([[Secure Sockets Layer]] — also known as SSL — is implied by HTTPS) and usually use the "POST" method (use of "GET" is rare).
* Messages can be signed, but do not have to be.
* Messages can be encrypted, but do not have to be.
* Messages may request a Message Disposition Notification [MDN] back if all went well, but do not have to request such a message.
* If the original AS2 message requested an MDN:
** Upon the receipt of the message and its successful decryption or signature validation (as necessary) a "success" MDN will be sent back to the original sender. This MDN is typically signed but never encrypted (unless temporarily encrypted in transit via HTTPS). 
***Upon the receipt and successful verification of the signature on the MDN, the original sender will "know" that the recipient got their message (this provides the "Non-repudiation" element of AS2)
** If there are any problems receiving or interpreting the original AS2 message, a "failed" MDN may be sent back. However, part of the AS2 protocol states that the client must treat a lack of an MDN as a failure as well, so some AS2 receivers will simply not return an MDN in this case. 

Like any other AS file transfer, AS2 file transfers typically require both sides of the exchange to trade SSL certificates and specific "trading partner" names before any transfers can take place. AS2 trading partner names can usually be any valid phrase.

=== MDN Options ===

Unlike AS1 or [[AS3 (networking)|AS3]] file transfers, AS2 file transfers offer several "MDN return" options instead of the traditional options of "yes" or "no". Specifically, the choices are:

====AS2 w/ "Sync" MDNs====
''Return Synchronous MDN via HTTP(S) ("AS2 Sync")'' - This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message sender clients over the same HTTP connection they used to send the original message. This "MDN while you wait" capability makes "AS2 Sync" transfers the fastest of any type of AS file transfer, but it also keeps this flavor of MDN request from being used with large files (which may [[time out (telecommunication)|time out]] in low-[[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] situations). 

====AS2 w/ "ASync" MDNs====
''Return Asynchronous MDN via HTTP(S) (a.k.a. "AS2 Async")'' - This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to the AS2 message sender's server later over a different HTTP connection. This flavor of MDN request is usually used if large files are involved. 

====AS2 w/ "Email" MDNs====
''Return (Asynchronous) MDN via Email'' - This rarely-used option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message senders via [[email]] rather than HTTP. Otherwise, it is similar to "AS2 Async (HTTP)".

====AS2 w/ No MDNs====
''Do not return MDN'' - This option works like it does in any other AS protocol: the receiver of an AS2 message with this option set simply does not try to return an MDN to the AS2 message sender.
====AS2 FileName Preserve ====

AS2 filename preservation feature will be used to communicate the filename to the trading partner. The banking industry relies on filenames being communicated between trading partners. AS2 vendors are currently certifying that implementation of filename communication conforms to the standard and is interoperable. 
There are two profiles for filename preservation being optionally tested under AS2 testing: 
*Filename preservation without MDN responses 
*Filename preservation with an associated MDN response certification

<title>AS9100</title>
<text>'''AS9100''' is a widely adopted and standardized [[quality management system]] for the [[aerospace]] industry.
It was released in October, 1999, by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] and the [[European Association of Aerospace Industries]].<ref>[http://www.qualitydigest.com/may02/html/as9100.html Aerospace's AS9100 QMS Standard]</ref><ref>[http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2001/10/aerospace_indus.html Aerospace Industry Readies for the AS9100]</ref>

AS9100 replaces the earlier [[AS9000]] and fully incorporates the entirety of the current version of [[ISO 9000]], while adding additional requirements relating to quality and safety.
Major aerospace manufacturers and suppliers worldwide require compliance and/or registration to AS9100 as a condition of doing business with them.<ref>[http://www.afnorindia.com/management-systems-certifications-services/as-9100-aerospace-quality-management-systems/ AS 9100 - Aerospace Quality]</ref><ref>[http://emea.bsi-global.com/Aerospace/Overview/TheHistoryofAS9100.xalter Aerospace AS9100, AS9110, AS9120]</ref>

==History==

Prior to the adoption of an aerospace specific quality standard, various corporations typically used ISO 9000 and their own complementary quality documentation/requirements, such as [[Boeing]]'s D1-9000 or the automotive Q standard.  This created a patchwork of competing requirements that were difficult to enforce and/or comply with.  The major American aerospace manufacturers combined their efforts to create a single, unified quality standard, resulting in AS9000.  Upon the release of AS9000, companies such as Boeing discontinued use of their previous quality supplements in preference to compliance to AS9000.

During the rewrite of ISO 9000 for the  year 2000 release, the AS group worked closely with the ISO organization.  As the year 2000 revision of ISO 9000 incorporated major organizational and philosophical changes, AS9000 underwent a rewrite as well.  It was released as AS9100 to the international aerospace industry at the same time as the new version of ISO 9000. 

AS9100 Revision C was released in January, 2009<ref>[http://www.iaqg.sae.org/servlets/productDetail?PROD_TYP=STD&amp;PROD_CD=AS9100C SAE International Publications]</ref>.

The IAQG Sanctioned Aerospace Auditor Transition Training was released May 1, 2010.<ref>[http://www.plexusintl.com Plexus International]</ref>

'''ASCII art''' is a [[graphic design]] technique that uses [[computer]]s for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) [[character (computing)|characters]] defined by the [[ASCII]] Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard [[7-bit ASCII]]<!-- leave it as 7-bit for accuracy -->). The term is also loosely used to refer to [[#Other text-based art|text based art in general]]. ASCII art can be created with any [[text editor]], and is often used with [[free-form language]]s. Most examples of ASCII [[art]] require a [[typeface#Proportion|fixed-width font]] (non-proportional [[typeface|fonts]], as on a traditional [[typewriter]]) such as [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] for presentation.

Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the
creations by computer-art pioneer [[Kenneth Knowlton]] from around 1966, who was working for [[Bell Labs]] at the time.<ref name="cgihist">{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}}</ref> "Studies in Perception I" by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.<ref name="sip1">{{Harvnb|Carlson|2003}} "1966 Studies in Perception I by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon (Bell Labs)", [http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/images/bell.jpg Image of Studies in Perception I]</ref>

One of the main reasons ASCII art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk. ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded.

==History==
===Typewriter art===
Since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art. The oldest known preserved example of typewriter art is a picture of a butterfly made in 1898 by Flora Stacey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|2001}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Robert|2005}}</ref>

In the 1954 short film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', typewriter art was a feature of the plot.

===TTY and RTTY===
TTY stands for "TeleTYpe" or "TeleTYpewriter" and is also known as [[Teleprinter]] or Teletype.
RTTY stands for [[Radioteletype]]. According to a chapter in the "RTTY Handbook",<ref name="rttyhb">{{Harvnb|Green|1972}}</ref> text images have been sent via teletypewriter as early as 1923. However, none of the "old" RTTY art has been discovered yet. What is known is that text images appeared frequently on radio teletype in the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref name="joan">{{Harvnb|Stark|2000}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rtty.com/gallery/rttyeasy.htm RTTY Art Made Easy, RTTY Journal November 1970]</ref>

===ASCII art===
[[Image:ASCII full.svg|frame|There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.]]
The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer [[bulletin board systems]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.

During the 1990s, graphical browsing and [[variable-width]] [[Computer font|fonts]] became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art.  Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online [[MUD]]s, an acronym for "Multi-User Dungeon", (which are textual [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] [[Computer role-playing game|roleplaying games]]), [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[E-mail]], [[message boards]] and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed [[fixed-width]].

Over the years, [[warez]] groups began to get into the ASCII art scene.<ref>{{Harvnb|Necromancer|1998}}</ref> Warez groups usually release [[.nfo]] files with their software, [[Software cracking|cracks]] or general illegal software reverse-engineering releases.<ref>{{Harvnb|Defacto2|2008}}</ref> The ASCII art will usually include the warez group's name and maybe some ASCII borders on the outsides of the release notes, etc.<ref>[http://www.defacto2.net/documents.cfm NFO Files collection at Defacto2.net, with NFO files that date back to 1989], retrieved February 17, 2008</ref>

==Uses==
[[Image:ASCII Panzer unt Sattelzug.png|right|thumb|A self-propelled gun and truck made using ASCII art]]
ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, [[teletype]]s, non-graphic [[computer terminal]]s, [[printer separator]]s, in early [[computer network]]ing (e.g., [[bulletin board system|BBSes]]), [[e-mail]], and [[Usenet]] news messages. ASCII art is also used within the [[source code]] of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art &amp;mdash; for instance, an entry to one of the earlier [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports.

Examples of ASCII-style art predating the modern computer era can be found in the June 1939, July 1948 and October 1948 editions of Popular Mechanics.<ref name="popscience">{{Harvnb|Cumbrowski|2007b}}</ref>

"0verkill" is a 2D platform multiplayer shooter game designed entirely in colour ASCII art. [[MPlayer]] and [[VLC media player]] can display videos as ASCII art. ASCII art is used in the making of DOS-based [[ZZT]] games.

Many game walkthrough guides come as part of a basic .txt file; this file often contains the name of the game in ASCII art. Such as below, word art is created using backslashes and other ASCII values in order to create the illusion of 3D.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}<!-- need source for illustration -->  Below is the title [[Metal Gear Solid]] in the style of ASCII art.

== Types and styles ==
Different techniques could be used in ASCII art to obtain different artistic effects:

 .--.     /\
 '--'    /__\    (^..^)~

- Line art, for creating shapes

 .g@8g.  db
 'Y8@P' d88b
- Solid art, for creating filled shapes

 :$#$: "4b. ':.
 :$#$:   "4b. ':.

- Shading, using different symbol density and shading for creating gradients or contrasts

   |\_/|        ****************************
  / @ @ \       *  "Purrrfectly pleasant"  *
 ( &amp;gt; º &amp;lt; )      *       Poppy Prinz        *
  `»»x««´       *       (pprinz@...)       *
  /  O  \       ****************************

- combinations used as SIG (signature) at the end of an email

=== Emoticons and verticons ===
{{Main|Emoticon}}
The simplest forms of ASCII art are combinations of two or three characters for expressing emotion in text.  They are commonly referred to as '[[emoticon]]', 'smilie', or '[[smiley]]'.

There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as [[Emoticon#East Asian style|kaomoji]] (literally "face characters".) Traditionally, they are referred to as "ASCII face ".

More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures.

====Popular smileys====
{{Main|List of common emoticons}}
The list only shows some popular examples for demonstration purposes. Hundreds of different text smileys were developed over time,<ref name="smileys2">{{Harvnb|textfiles|2008}}</ref> but only a few were generally accepted, used and understood.

===Styles of the computer underground text art scene===
====Atari 400/800 ATASCII====
The [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400/800]] did not follow the ASCII standard and had its own character set, called [[ATASCII]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Štěrba|2005}} (gif image)</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Moeser|Fusik|2007}}</ref> The emergence of ATASCII art coincided with the growing popularity of [[Bulletin board system|BBS Systems]] caused by availability of the [[acoustic coupler]]s that were compatible with the 8-bit home computers. ATASCII text animations are also referred to as "break animations" by the Atari sceners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

====C-64 PETSCII====
The [[Commodore 64]], which was released in 1982, also did not follow the ASCII standard. The C-64 character set is called [[PETSCII]], an extended form of [[ASCII|ASCII-1963]]. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations.

===="Block ASCII" / "High ASCII" style ASCII art on the IBM PC====
[[Image:ASCII notepad acidview compare.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Block ASCII display via Notepad versus ACiDView for Windows]]
So-called "block ASCII" or "high ASCII" uses the extended characters of the 8-bit [[code page 437]], which is a proprietary standard introduced by [[IBM]] in 1979 (ANSI Standard x3.16) for the IBM PC and MS DOS operating system. "Block ASCIIs" were widely used on the PC during the 1990s until the Internet replaced BBSes as the main communication platform. Until then, "block ASCIIs" dominated the [[Computer art scene|PC Text Art Scene]].<ref name="asciistyles">[http://www.RoySAC.com/roy-sac_styles_of_underground_text_art.asp The three Styles of the Underground ASCII Art Scene], Article 01, 2006, Roy/[[Superior Art Creations|SAC]], [http://www.RoySAC.com RoySAC.com]</ref><ref name="ddarthistory">[http://cd.textfiles.com/darkdomain/www/html/history-art_scene.html An Abbreviated History of the Underground Computer Art Scene] by Napalm, 11/10/1998, The History of Art and Technology</ref>

The first art scene group that focused on the extended character set of the PC in their art work was called "Aces of ANSI Art," or "AAA." Some members of left in 1990, and formed a group called [[ACiD Productions|ACiD]], "ANSI Creators in Demand." In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, [[iCE Advertisements|ICE]], "Insane Creators Enterprise".<ref name="100years">[http://www.cow.net/conned/notacon/artscene/notacon-100artscene-transcript.txt 100 YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ART SCENE], Presented by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky]] and [[RaD Man]] ([[ACiD Productions|ACiD]]), [[Notacon]] Conference - Cleveland, Ohio, USA, April 23-25th, 2004</ref>

There is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with "Hardcore" ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact [[ANSI art]], because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.<!--original sentence was entirely ungrammatical; I hope this one gets the proper meaning across-->

Microsoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font "[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#.22Block.22 ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt.

===="Amiga"/"Oldskool" style ASCII art====
[[Image:Paso-IceCream-AmigaVsPC.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Oldschool/Amiga ASCII look on Commodore Amiga Computer versus look on the IBM PC (notice the tight spacing)]]
In the art scene one popular ASCII style that used the 7-bit standard ASCII character set was the so called "[[Old school|Oldskool]]" Style. It is also called "Amiga style", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] Computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <tt>_/\-+=.()&amp;lt;&amp;gt;:</tt>. The "oldskool" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.
This is an example of "[[Amiga]] style" (also referred to as "old school" or "oldskool" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name="asciistyles" />

The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, 7 years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal. This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style "Oldskool". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.

The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called "ASCII collections" and not "art packs" like on the IBM PC.

This kind of ASCII art is hand made in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include [[CygnusEd]]itor aka CED ([[Amiga]]) and [[EditPlus|EditPlus2]] ([[Wintel|PC]]).

====Newskool style ASCII art====
[[Image:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII Screenshot]]
"Newskool" is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like  "$#Xxo".  In spite of its name, the style is not "new"; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by "Oldskool" and "Block" style ASCII art. It was dubbed "Newskool" upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.<ref name="asciistyles" />

Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[Character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for "fine tuning" and "tweaking". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]].

==Methods for generating ASCII art==
{{Main|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}}

While some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard.

The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as TheDraw and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP.

===Image to text conversion===
{{Main|ASCII art converters}}

Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value.

Examples of converted images are given below.

This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art, dating back to the early days of the 1960s [[minicomputer]]s and [[teletype]]s. During the 1970s it was popular in [[shopping mall|malls]] to get a [[t-shirt]] with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer. With the advent of the web and [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full [[RGB]] colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images.

Since the appearance of the first simple converter tools, individuals have converted images to ASCII art automatically and afterwards claimed that they generated the result themselves "by hand" via a text editor.

Images that were converted to text, where no touch up work was done after the conversion, can in almost every case be identified as such, at least by an experienced text artist. The detection of converted, software-generated text art becomes much more difficult if some time was spent by the editor to touch up the details that are typical indicators of auto-generation.  The inconsistencies in "shading" in just one art piece are often what gives the software-created status away.

Still images or movies can also be converted to ASCII on various Linux and UNIX computers using the [http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib aalib (black and white)] or [http://sam.zoy.org/libcaca libcaca (colour)] graphics device driver, or the VLC media player; all of which render the screen using ASCII symbols instead of pixels.  See also [http://oreilly.com/pub/h/4441 O'Reilly article "Watch Videos in ASCII art"].

==Non fixed-width ASCII==
Most ASCII art is created using a [[monospace font]], where all characters are identical in width ([[Courier (typeface)|Courier New]] is a popular monospace font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospace fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as [[Arial]] or [[Times New Roman]], where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.

Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.

==Animated ASCII art==
Animated ASCII art started in 1970  from so-called VT100 animations produced on [[vt100]] terminals. These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions, deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated. Usually, they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story.

Contemporary [[web browser]] revitalized animated ASCII art again. It became possible to display animated ASCII art via [[JavaScript]] or [[Java (Sun)|Java applets]]. Static ASCII art pictures are loaded and displayed one after another, creating the animation, very similar to how movie projectors  unreel film reel and project the individual pictures on the big screen at movie theaters. A new term was born: ''ASCIImation'' - another name of Animated ASCII Art. A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation.<ref>{{cite web

There are now many tools and programs that can transform raster images into text symbols; some of these tools can operate on streaming video. For example, the music video for pop singer [[Beck Hansen]]'s song "Black Tambourine"<ref name="beckbt">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ncgg4eGYO0 Black Tambourine] ASCIImation Music Video by [[Beck Hansen]] at [[YouTube.com]]</ref> is made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage.

==Other text-based art==
There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as "ASCII art". The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or [[pseudo-graphics]].

===ANSI art===
{{Main|ANSI art}}
The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, 8 background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the [[Windows ANSI code page]]) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

===Shift_JIS===
[[File:Mona01.svg|thumb|{{nihongo|'''Monā'''|モナー|Monā}} Posted on {{nihongo|'''[[2ch]]'''|２ちゃんねる|Nichanneru}} in 2000]]
{{Main|Shift_JIS art}}
A large character selection and the availability of fixed-width characters allow Japanese users to use [[Shift JIS]] as a text-based art on Japanese websites.

===Unicode===
{{Main|Unicode}}
[[Unicode]] would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for [[xterm]]. Windows has the [[Courier New]] font which includes characters like ┌╥─╨┐♥☺♫Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ) Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used.

===Overprinting (surprint)===
In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting &amp;mdash; the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color

<title>ASEA IRB</title>
<text>{{orphan|date=December 2008}}
The '''ASEA IRB''' is an industrial robot series for material handling, packing, transportation, polishing, welding, and grading.  Built in 1975, the robot allowed movement in 5 axes with a lift capacity of 6 [[Kilogram|kg]].  It was the world's first fully electrically driven and microprocessor-controlled robot, using [[Intel]]'s first chipset.

The ASEA IRB was constructed by [[Björn Weichbrodt]], [[Ove Kullborg]], [[Bengt Nilsson]] and [[Herbert Kaufmann]] and was manufactured by [[ASEA]] in [[Sweden]]/[[Västerås]]. The first model, IRB 6, was developed in 1972-1973 on assignment by the ASEA [[CEO]] [[Curt Nicolin]] and was shown for the first time at the end of August 1973. The example shown in the [[technical museum]] is the first robot that was sold. It was bought by Magnussons in [[Genarp]] to wax and polish rust-free tubes bent at 90° [[angle]]s. This robot was donated to the museum during ASEA's 100-year anniversary in 1983.

The IRB 6 sold 1900 copies during the next 17 years (1975-1992).  It became the [[Sweden|Swedish]] symbol for a new [[Labour economics|Labour market]], shared between man and robot.<ref>{{cite web|title=IRB 6 The world's first completely fully electrically driven and microprocessor controlled robot.|url=http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/robotics/utst/fabriken/IRB6.htm}} 070516 tekniskamuseet.se (in [[Swedish language]])</ref>

<title>ASTAR</title>
<text>{{otheruses|Astar (disambiguation)}}
{{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}}

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:astar.gif|frame|right|Original appearance of ASTAR]] --> 
ASTAR is a fictional golden [[humanoid]] [[robot]] from ''Planet Danger''. The character was created in the 1980s by the [[Canadian]] [[amputee]] organization [[The War Amps]] and is featured in material for their ''PLAYSAFE'' program to educate children about safety. 

The original televised segment featured a performer in an elaborate costume as ASTAR performing acrobatic stunts in a world full of dangerous machines. After evading various threats such as electrical hazards and moving blades, ASTAR eventually makes a mistake causing his arm to be amputated by a large rotating saw. He then picks up his severed arm and reattaches it with ease. The segment ends with ASTAR giving the warning:

<blockquote>:I am ASTAR, a robot. I can put my arm back on. You can't. So play safe!</blockquote>

The above warning is now part of Canadian [[popular culture]] for those who grew up in the 1980s. In a recent remake of the segment, ASTAR is now an animated [[CG]] character, and the warning is altered slightly to "I am ASTAR, a robot '''from Planet Danger'''. I can put my arm back on. You can't. So play safe!"

'''ATI Technologies Inc''', is a major designer and supplier of [[graphics processing unit]]s and motherboard [[chipsets]] based in [[Canada]]. In 2006, the company was acquired by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) and was renamed to the AMD Graphics Products group.  Despite the acquisition, the ATI brand was retained for graphics cards until August 30, 2010. AMD have announced that it will retire the "ATI" name and instead brand its graphics chipsets as "AMD" beginning in late 2010.<ref>http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/358774/ati_re-branded_amd/</ref>

ATi Technologies is a [[fabless semiconductor company]] conducting in-house [[research and development]] and [[outsourcing]] the [[manufacturing]] and assembly of its products. Its main competitor is [[NVIDIA]] in the graphics and handheld market. The flagship product, the [[Radeon]] series of graphics cards, directly competes with [[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce]]. These two companies' dominance of the market forced other manufacturers into niche roles.

==History==
Lee Ka Lau<ref>[http://www.giving.utoronto.ca/chairs/showchairs.asp?ID=19 University of Toronto Division of University Advancement page]. Retrieved February 28, 2008.</ref>, Benny Lau and Kwok Yuen Ho<ref>[http://www.ati.com/designpartners/media/bios/kyho.html K.Y. Ho biography on ATI website]</ref> founded ATI in 1985 as "Array Technologies Incorporated". Working primarily in the [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as [[IBM]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder graphics card product lines under its brand that year<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Weblets/0,,7832_10554,00.html?redir=AAMD04#1980 History of AMD at AMD.com]</ref>. In May 1991, the company released the Mach8, ATI's first product able to process graphics without the CPU. Debuting in 1992, the Mach32 offered improved memory bandwidth and [[graphical user interface|GUI]] acceleration performance. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993 with stock listed at [[NASDAQ]] and [[Toronto Stock Exchange]].

[[File:AMDmarkham4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AMD Markham at the former ATI headquarters.]]
[[File:Atitechnologiessiliconvalley.jpg|thumb|right|250px|ATI's former Silicon Valley office.]]
[[File:ATI Wonder.jpg|thumb|ATI VGA Wonder with 256 kB RAM.]]

In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for [[YUV]]-to-[[RGB]] [[color space]] conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.

ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] accelerator under the name [[ATI Rage|3D Rage]]. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the [[ATI Rage|Rage Pro]] was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to [[3Dfx]]'s 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced [[DirectX|DirectX 6.0]] accelerator in the 1999 [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]].

The [[All-in-Wonder]] product line introduced in 1996 was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with [[TV tuner card]] and the first chip that enabled to display computer graphics on a TV set<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Weblets/0,,7832_10554,00.html?redir=AAMD04#1990 History of AMD - 1996 at AMD.com]</ref>. The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's second generation 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analog video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception.

ATI made an entrance into the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to [[laptop]]s in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from desktop PC, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired [[Tseng Labs]]'s graphics assets, which included 40 [[engineer]]s.

The [[Radeon]] line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon [[graphics processing unit]] was an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.

In 2000, ATI acquired [[ArtX]], which engineered the [[Nintendo GameCube#Graphics Processing Unit and System Chipset|Flipper]] graphics chip used in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] game console. They have also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed [[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]) for the successor of the [[GameCube]], the [[Wii]]. ATI was contracted by [[Microsoft]] to create the graphics core (codenamed [[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]) for the [[Xbox 360]]. Later in 2005, ATI acquired [[Terayon's]] cable modem [[silicon intellectual property]] strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market<ref>[http://apps.ati.com/ir/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=105421&amp;releaseID=671557 press release]</ref>. K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. [[David E. Orton|Dave Orton]] replaced him as the President and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the organization.

On July 24, 2006, [[Advanced Micro Devices]] and ATI announced a plan to [[mergers and acquisitions|merge]] together in a deal valued at $5.4 billion. The merger closed on October 25, 2006<ref>[http://ir.ati.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=105421&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=921365&amp;highlight= Press Release]</ref>. The acquisition consideration included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~113656,00.html AMD page]</ref>. ATI retained its name, logos and trademarks. ATI's then CEO Dave Orton was made the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/InvestorRelations/0,,51_306_14668,00.html AMD 2006 December Analyst Day page]</ref>.

It was reported that in December 2006 AMD/ATI, along with its main rival NVIDIA, received subpoenas from the [[United States Department of Justice]] regarding possible [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] violations in the graphics card industry<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9584_22-6140041.html|title=Justice Dept. subpoenas AMD, NVIDIA|publisher=New York Times|date= 1 December 2006}}</ref>.

In July 2007, AMD announced the resignation of Dave Orton. ATI, a subsidiary of AMD, is called the Graphics Product Group (GPG) inside the company<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/InvestorRelations/0,,51_306_15086,00.html AMD 2007 Analyst Day page]</ref>. The top-level management of the Graphics Product Group consists of Rick Bergman, Senior Vice President and General Manager and Adrian Hartog, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group. Both report to [[Dirk Meyer]], CEO of AMD<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/AboutAMD/0,,51_52_570,00.html Corporate Information - Executive Biographies at AMD.com]</ref>.

On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD will retire the "ATI" brand for its graphics chipsets, and will brand future products as "AMD".<ref>http://news.softpedia.com/news/AMD-Really-Dropping-the-ATI-Brand-154168.shtml</ref>

[[Image:Ruby's Revenge 1024.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ATI's Ruby fictional female character.]]

In addition to developing high-end [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s (originally called a VPU, visual processing unit, by ATI) for PCs And Apple Macs, ATI also designs embedded versions for laptops (Mobility Radeon), [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s and [[mobile phone]]s ([[Imageon]]), integrated motherboards (Radeon IGP), and others.

{{Expand list|date=April 2010}}

*'''[[ATI Wonder series|Graphics Solution / "Small Wonder"]]''' - Series of 8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] cards with [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]], [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Plantronics Colorplus|Plantronics Color+]] compatibility. Later versions added [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] support.
*'''[[ATI Wonder series|EGA / VGA Wonder]]''' - [[IBM]] "[[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]]/[[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]-compatible" display adapters (1987)
*'''[[ATI Mach|Mach]] Series''' - Introduced ATI's first [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]] "Windows Accelerator". As the series evolved, GUI acceleration improved dramatically and early video acceleration appeared.
*'''[[ATI Rage|Rage]] Series''' - ATI's first 2D and [[3D accelerator]] chips. The series evolved from rudimentary 3D with 2D GUI acceleration and [[MPEG-1]] capability, to a highly competitive [[Direct3D]] 6 accelerator with then "best-in-class" DVD ([[MPEG2]]) acceleration. The various chips were very popular with [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s of the time. The Rage II was used in the first ATI [[All-In-Wonder]] multi-function video card, and more advanced All-In-Wonders based on Rage series GPUs followed. (1995–2004)
**'''[[ATI_Rage#Mobility|Rage Mobility]]''' - Designed for use in low-power environments, such as notebooks. These chips were functionally similar to their desktop counterparts, but had additions such as advanced [[power management]], [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] interfaces, and [[Multi monitor|dual monitor]] functionality.

*'''[[Radeon]] Series''' - Launched in 2000, the Radeon line is ATI's brand for their consumer 3D accelerator add-in cards. The original ''Radeon DDR'' was ATI's first DirectX 7 3D accelerator, introducing their first hardware [[transform and lighting|T&amp;L]] engine. ATI often produced 'Pro' versions with higher clock speeds, and sometimes an extreme 'XT' version, and even more recently 'XT Platinum Edition (PE)' and 'XTX' versions. The Radeon series was the basis for many ATI All-In-Wonder boards.
**'''[[Radeon|Mobility Radeon]]''' - A series of power-optimized versions of Radeon graphics chips for use in laptops.  They introduced innovations such as modularized RAM chips, [[DVD]] (MPEG2) acceleration, notebook GPU card sockets, and "[[ATI PowerPlay|PowerPlay]]" power management technology. AMD recently announced DirectX 11-compatible versions of its mobile processors<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.techworld.com/mobile-wireless/3209713/amd-launches-directx-11-graphics-chips-for-laptops/|title=AMD launches DirectX 11 graphics chips for laptops|date=2010-01-08| publisher=techworld.com|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>.
**'''[[ATI CrossFire]]''' - This technology was ATI's response to [[NVIDIA]]'s [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] platform. It allowed, by using a secondary video card and a dual PCI-E motherboard based on an ATI Crossfire-compatible chipset, the ability to combine the power of the two, three or four video cards to increase performance through a variety of different rendering options. There is an option for additional PCI-E video card plugging into the third PCI-E slot for gaming physics, or another option to do physics on the second video card<ref>[http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=5634 DailyTech report]</ref>.
*'''[[FireGL]]''' - Launched in 2001, following ATI's acquisition of FireGL Graphics from [[Diamond Multimedia]]. Workstation CAD/CAM video card, based on the Radeon series.
*'''[[FireMV]]''' - For workstations, featuring multi-view, a technology for the need of multiple displays for workstations with 2D acceleration only, usually based on the low-end products of the Radeon series.

*'''[[AMD 700 chipset series]]''' - exclusively for AMD processors, this is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (790FX), enthusiast chipset (790X), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] (790GX, 785G, 780G, 740G) and single graphics card variants (770, 740) aimed at mainstream and value computing systems available.
*'''[[AMD 800 chipset series]]''' - exclusively for AMD processors, It includes support for up to six [[Serial ATA#SATA Revision 3.0 (SATA 6Gb/s)|SATA 6.0 Gbit/s]] ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] processors and [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] 1.2 with SATA [[port multiplier#FIS(Frame Information Structure)–based switching|FIS–based switching]] support. This is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (890FX), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]](890GX).

In addition to the above chipset ATI has announced that a deal has been struck with [[CPU]] and [[Motherboard]] manufacturers as of 2005, particularly [[Asus]] and [[Intel]], to create onboard 3D Graphics solutions for [[Intel]]'s new range of motherboards that will be released with their range of [[Intel]] [[Pentium M]]-based desktop processors, the [[Intel Core]] and [[Intel Core 2]] processors, the D101GGC and D101GGC2 chipset (codenamed "''Grand County''"<ref>[http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/32/94/329441_329441.pdf Intel Boxed Desktop Board Quick Guide (December 2006)]</ref>) based on the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] chipset. However, high-end boards with integrated graphics processor (IGP) will still use [[Intel]] [[Intel GMA|GMA]] [[graphics processing unit|integrated graphics processor]]s. The deal with Intel was deemed to be officially ended with the purchase of ATI Technologies from AMD in July 2006, with Intel announcing [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] IGP chipset (D201GLY chipset, codenamed "''Little Valley''") for entry-level desktop platform, replacing the "''Grand County''" series chipsets.

===Multimedia and Digital TV products===
*'''[[All-In-Wonder]]''' series - A series of multimedia graphics cards which incorporating TV tuner and [[Radeon]] family [[video card|graphics card]]s onto one add-in card, which, after being seemingly discontinued was relaunched as All-In-Wonder HD on June 26, 2008.
*TV tuners
**'''TV Wonder''' and '''HDTV Wonder''' - a chipset family providing TV reception of various analog TV and digital TV signals ([[PAL]], [[NTSC]], [[ATSC]], [[DVB-T]] and so on) with first generation [[AVIVO]] technology, also supporting [[CableCARD]], and [[QAM tuner|Clear QAM]] technologies.
**'''Theater''' - a family of [[QAM]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|VSB]] demodulators for the Digital Cable ready and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] environments.
*'''Remote Wonder''', wireless remote control series for ATI multimedia products. Operates using radio frequency, away from mainstream implementations using [[Infrared#Communications|infrared]].

===Console graphics products===
*'''[[Nintendo GameCube#Technical specifications|Flipper]]''' - The [[Nintendo GameCube]] (codenamed "dolphin" during production) contains a 3D accelerator developed by ''ArtX, Inc'', a company acquired by ATI during the development of the GPU. Flipper is similar in capability to a [[Direct3D]] 7 accelerator chip. It consists of four rendering pipelines, with hardware [[transform and lighting|T&amp;L]], and some limited pixel shader support. Innovatively the chip has 3 [[MiB]] of embedded [[1T-SRAM]] for use as ultra-fast low-latency (6.2 [[nanosecond|ns]]) texture and [[framebuffer]]/[[Z-buffer]] storage allowing 10.4 [[gigabytes|GB]]/second bandwidth (extremely fast for the time). Flipper was designed by members of the [[Nintendo 64]] Reality Coprocessor team who moved from SGI. The Flipper team went on to have a major hand in the development of the [[Radeon 9700]].
*'''[[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]''' - [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ATI, known as "R500", "C1", or more often as ''Xenos''. Some of these features include the embedded DRAM ([[eDRAM]]). The Xenos also features the “True Unified Shader Architecture” which dynamically loads and balances pixel and vertex processing amongst a bank of identically capable processing units. This differs greatly from past-generations PC graphics chips that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task (vertex/fragment). Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware [[tessellation#Tessellations and computer graphics|surface tessellation]] to divide a surface into smaller triangles, similar to [[TruForm]] in terms of functionality, which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the most up-to-date [[Direct3D#Direct3D 10|DirectX 10]] specification. The recent generation [[Radeon R600]] GPU core inherited most of the features presented in Xenos, except [[eDRAM]].
*'''[[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]''' - Successor to Flipper. Part of [[Nintendo]]'s latest gaming console, [[Wii]].

===Handheld chipsets===
*'''[[Imageon]]''' - [[System-on-a-chip]] (SoC) design introduced in 2002 to bring integrated [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics to handhelds devices, cellphones and [[Tablet PC]]s. Current top-of-line product is the Imageon 2298 which includes DVD quality recording and playback, TV output, and supports up to a 12-[[megapixel]] camera, with another line of Imageon products, the 2300 series supporting [[OpenGL]] ES 1.1+ extensions. The Imageon line was rebranded under AMD, after AMD acquired ATI in Q3 2006, as '''AMD Imageon'''.
*'''[[Imageon|Imageon TV]]''' - Announced in February 2006, allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast TV ([[DVB-H]]) signals and enables watching TV programs on these devices, the chipset includes tuner, demodulator, decoder, and a full software stack, operates alongside the [[Imageon]] chip.

Besides full products, ATI has also supplied 3D and 2D graphics components to other vendors, specifically the [[Qualcomm]]<ref>[http://brew.qualcomm.com/bnry_brew/pdf/brew_2007/Tech-303_Ligon.pdf page 10 and 15]</ref> [[MSM7000]] series SoC chips of handheld and upcoming [[Freescale]] i. MX processors<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Freescale+Licenses+AMD+Technologies/article8909.htm DailyTech report]. Retrieved September 17, 2007.</ref>. ATI claimed in May 2006, that it had sold over 100 million<ref>[http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=31938 The Inquirer report]</ref> 'cell phone media co-processors', significantly more than ATI's rival NVIDIA, and announced in February 2007 that the firm had shipped a total of 200 million of Imageon products since 2003<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~115795,00.html AMD press release]. Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref>.

In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to [[Qualcomm]], so there will be no new Imageon products.

===High Performance Computing===
*'''[[AMD FireStream]]''', originally ATI Firestream, and previously rebranded as '''AMD Stream Processor''' for a short period of time, utilizing the [[stream processing]] concept, together with [[Close to Metal]] (CTM) hardware interface.

==ATI graphics drivers==
===Proprietary===
{{Main|ATI Catalyst}}

ATI currently provides proprietary graphics [[Device Driver|drivers]], and also assists development of open source drivers. The proprietary drivers are called ATI Catalyst, and are available for most platforms: [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 7]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]]. Linux users can also opt to use open source drivers.

===Open source===
{{Main|Graphics hardware and FOSS#ATI/AMD|l1=Graphics hardware and FOSS}}

Hardware component companies which only provide proprietary drivers have always been urged by the Linux community to open source their drivers, or at least provide the necessary documentation for the community to write their own drivers. In a 2002 interview with AMD official Hal Speed, it was suggested that AMD were strongly considering making the functional part of the ATI drivers open source<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/02/32OPcurve_1.html 'AMD talks about ATI' at InfoWorld.com]</ref>. However, until the merger with AMD, ATI had no plans to release their graphics drivers as open source code:
{{Quote|Proprietary, patented optimizations are part of the value we provide to our customers and we have no plans to release these drivers to open source. In addition, multimedia elements such as content protection must not, by their very nature, be allowed to go open source.|[http://news.com.com/2061-10791_3-6104655.html ATI statement, August 2006]}}

Since 2007 ATI has cooperated with the development of open source graphics drivers. Although ATI has not made their Catalyst drivers open source, the programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features were published in several rounds. This greatly changed their support of the development of open source graphics drivers, as until that moment only unsupported open source drivers existed. Besides releasing the specifications, ATI also funded the development of new open source drivers, by Novell, for the newest generation of video cards.

<title>AUSM</title>
<text>{{for|the New Zealand students' union|AuSM}}
'''AUSM''' stands for Advection Upstream Splitting Method. It is developed as a numerical inviscid flux function for solving a general system of conservation equations. It is based on the upwind concept and was motivated to provide an alternative approach to other upwind methods, such as the Godunov method, flux difference splitting methods by Roe, and Solomon and Osher, flux vector splitting methods by Van Leer, and Steger and Warming. The AUSM first recognizes that the inviscid flux consist of two physically distinct parts, i.e., convective and pressure fluxes. The former is associated with the flow (advection) speed, while the latter with the acoustic speed; or respectively classified as the linear and nonlinear fields. Currently, the convective and pressure fluxes are formulated using the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian matrices. The method was originally proposed by Liou and Steffen <ref>Liou, M.-S. and Steffen, C., “A New Flux Splitting Scheme,” J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 107, 23-39, 1993.</ref> for the typical compressible aerodynamic flows, and later substantially improved in <ref name="firstName">Liou, M.-S., “A Sequel to AUSM: AUSM+” J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 129, 364-382, 1996.</ref><ref>Wada, Y. and Liou, M.-S., “An Accurate and Robust Flux Splitting Scheme for Shock and Contact Discontinuities,” SIAM J. Scientific Computing, Vol. 18, 633-657, 1997.</ref> to yield a more accurate and robust version. To extend its capabilities, it has been further developed in <ref name="secondName">Liou, M.-S., “A Sequel to AUSM, Part II: AUSM+-up” J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 214, 137- 170, 2006.
</ref><ref>Edwards, J. R., Franklin, R., and Liou, M.-S., “Low-Diffusion Flux-Splitting Methods for Real Fluid Flows with Phase Transitions,” AIAA J., Vol. 38, 1624-1633, 2000.</ref><ref>Chang, C.-H. and Liou, M.-S., “A New Approach to the Simulation of Compressible Multifluid Flows with AUSM+ Scheme,” AIAA Paper 2003-4107, 16th AIAA CFD Conference, Orlando, FL, June 23–26, 2003.</ref> for all speed-regimes and multiphase flow. Its variants have also been proposed<ref>Edwards, J. R. and Liou, M.-S., “Low-Diffusion Flux-Splitting Methods for Flows at All Speeds,” AIAA J., Vol. 36, 1610-1617, 1998.</ref><ref>Kim, K. H., Kim, C., and Rho, O., “Methods for the Accurate Computations of Hypersonic Flows I. AUSMPW+ Scheme,” J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 174, 38-80, 2001.</ref>.

==Features==
The Advection Upstream Splitting Method has many features. The main features are:
*accurate capturing of shock and contact discontinuities
*entropy-satisfying solution
*positivity-preserving solution
*algorithmic simplicity (not requiring explicit eigen-structure of the flux Jacobian matrices) and straightforward extension to additional conservation laws
*free of “carbuncle” phenomena
*uniform accuracy and convergence rate for all Mach numbers.
Since the method does not specifically require eigenvectors, it is especially attractive for the system whose eigen-structure is not known explicitly, as the case of two-fluid equations for multiphase flow.

==Applications==
The AUSM has been employed to solve a wide range of problems, low-Mach to [[hypersonic]] [[aerodynamics]], large eddy simulation and aero-acoustics<ref>Mary, I. and Sagaut, P., “Large Eddy Simulation of Flow Around an Airfoil Near Stall,” AIAA J., Vol. 40, 1139-1145, 2002.</ref><ref>Manoha, E., Redonnet, S., Terracol, M., and Guenanff, G., “Numerical Simulation of Aerodynamics Noise,” ECCOMAS 24–28 July 2004.</ref>, direct numerical simulation<ref>Billet, G. and Louedin, O., “Adaptive Limiters for Improving the Accuracy of the MUSCL Approach for Unsteady Flows,” J.

'''Aaron Doral''' ('''Number Five''') is a [[fictional character]] from the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series.

Doral is a humanoid [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] (designated model Number Five)<ref>[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)]]</ref> who first appeared as a civilian public relations specialist aboard ''Galactica'' just prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Through conversation with the Cylon agent [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]], [[Gaius Baltar|Dr. Gaius Baltar]] claims Doral is a Cylon spy and has him thrown in the brig. Gaius does so to protect himself and justify the finding of a Cylon device he has noticed, Doral actually being a spy is mere coincidence. Doral emphatically denies being a Cylon. However, not willing to take a chance, Doral is abandoned by [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] on the Ragnar Anchorage weapons depot. At the time of abandonment, Doral exclaims his innocence, and claims to be from Oasis, outside Caprica City, and having been on Kobol College on Gemenon. The audience is shown that Baltar was correct in assuming Doral a Cylon, four copies of Doral, along with Number Six, [[Leoben Conoy]], and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon]] come to his rescue. (In the novelization, Doral is a [[sleeper agent]] - he does not know he is a Cylon until the others come for him at Ragnar Anchorage.)

Doral appears again on Cylon-occupied [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]] curiously monitoring the situation developing between Sharon and [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]]. He initially decides that Sharon cannot be trusted, and orders Number Six to deal with her. Once Doral discovers that Sharon is pregnant, he states the child is a miracle, and must be protected at all costs. The discovery also leads to his suggesting a major tactical change, although the details of this new plan, as well as whatever changes were made from the original, have as yet to be clearly defined in the series.

The Doral Cylons seem to act more covertly, having an unassuming "average" appearance in order to better blend in with more trivial background matters instead of taking more noticeable positions of authority and purpose. He seems to have a position of authority among the Cylons, acting as overseer, and having a hand behind their decision making and tactical planning. This personalization is contradicted, however, in the special TV movie "[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]," in which a copy of Cavil berates a confused Doral copy (wearing clothing nearly identical to the first copy encountered by the Colonials) for his lack of disguise and caution while wandering the halls of Galactica. A later scene shows a small group of Doral copies assigned to menial labor on occupied Caprica, doing work they complain is below them and should be handled by centurions. Likewise, in the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]," a copy of Doral can be seen serving drinks to other humanoid Cylons. These scenes seem to imply the Doral models are of lower intelligence than other Cylon models, and possess less authority.

The Doral Cylons appear to be more fanatical, militant and cold-hearted than the other humanoid Cylons encountered thus far, short of the often vile, overtly vicious [[Brother Cavil]]. They calmly discuss the genocide of mankind (stating on one occasion "They [humans] would have destroyed themselves anyway. They deserve what they got."), and unhesitatingly conducting (on at least one occasion) a suicide bombing aboard ''Galactica''<ref>[[Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)|Litmus]]</ref>. On the other hand, Doral was highly critical of the human suicide bombers in "[[Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)|Occupation]]" who inflicted Cylon casualties and fatalities, lambasting them for a 'lack of nobility'.

In "[[Torn(Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]" a Number Eight accuses Doral of "barely even being able to say [God's] name."

<text>{{Notability|date=April 2010}}
'''Ability Online''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] online community for children and young adults facing any sort of [[disability]] (intellectual or physical), chronic illness, or other social challenge. The site offers a protected and nurturing environment where these children can overcome the social isolation often associated with having such challenges, and connect with friends, mentors, homework tutors and job search coaches. 

The site was founded in 1991 by [[Arlette Lefebvre|Dr. Arlette Lefebvre]] (aka "Dr. Froggie") from the [[Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and Brian Hillis with the goal of helping to inspire children to feel good about themselves, to understand that there are others who have faced (and overcome) similar challenges, and to provide the social networks and skills required to help them integrate more fully into their communities.

Membership is open to kids of all ages and their families and caregivers, and is free of charge. Members are manually screened and verified prior to being given access to the site, and all public messages on the site are monitored by police-screened volunteers.

<title>Ability Plus</title>
<text>[[Image:AbilityPlus3 0.png|thumb|alt=Screen shot of Ability Plus 3.0|Screen shot of Ability Plus 3.0]]'''Ability Plus''' is an integrated software package written for DOS in the early 80s. Development ceased in 1995 with the last build made in November 1997.  It was succeeded by Ability Office on Windows, described below.

Ability combined write, spreadsheet, database, graphing and communication functions in a single interface called the Library Screen. The main modules were written from the ground up to share as much code as possible so that, for example, a field in the write or database module would call on the same recalculation engine as the spreadsheet and the display and print routines were common to all.

Despite lack of development for over a decade, Ability Plus 3.0, the last version, will still run quite happily under a [[Windows 7]] command prompt.

==Marketing History==
Xanaro Technologies, in Toronto, Ontario, initially sought to market Ability<ref name="xanaro">[http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Business/IBM-Office-System-May-Outstrip-Competition-DDB-Left-Holding-Atari-IOU.html  faqs.org], Business abstract 1984.</ref> in 1984. After a business reorganization at the request of the investors, the product was taken over by Migent Inc, Incline Village, Nevada, around 1984/85 and released as Ability 1.2 in 1985.

A new version called Ability Plus was released in 1987 by Migent, that saw the product translated into a French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and other European languages.

Around this time in Europe, Ability 1.2 and Ability Plus 1.0 were widely bundled with the [[Amstrad 1512]] and 1640 personal computers. In 1987 Ability Plus won the Barclays Bank British Micro Computing Award.

Migent Inc had several products, including the first "pocket modem", but fell into financial difficulty for reasons largely unrelated to Ability (for example, see Migent vs [[Ashton-Tate]]<ref name="emeraldbay">[http://corphist.computerhistory.org/corphist/view.php?s=documents&amp;id=899&amp;PHPSESSID=ccd241...  Corporate Histories Collection]</ref>) and eventually reversed into LANware Inc, Markham, Canada in 1989<ref name="lanware">[http://www.cbronline.com/news/migent_software_plans_to_reverse_itself_into_lanware CBR News], April 1989.</ref>. Migent (UK) Ltd, based in London, continued for a few more years, eventually closing in 1991.

Later on in 1991, a new company was set up in the UK, [[Ability Plus Software|Ability Plus Software (UK) Ltd]], and it joined forces with LANware, with new funding, to develop and market a new version of Ability Plus (version 2.0) which was released in 1992 and then version 3.0 in 1995.

By this time, the popularity of DOS based programs was in decline and in addition, Ability Plus suffered from the lack of development investment in the period following the launch of version 1.0 (almost no development took place from 1988 to 1991).

==Development==
Ability was originally developed by a team all of whom came from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada<ref name="waterloo">[http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=84426&amp;cid=7373969 Slashdot ], 2003 thread.</ref>. By the time of Ability Plus, the majority of the code was in C with a small amount of assembly.

The following list of contributors is lifted directly from the Ability Plus line of source code, in approximately chronological order, with given year showing an earliest date for "first appearance":  (1984) Ashok Patel, Tracey Allen, Andrew Forber, Richard B. McMurray, Tom Keith, Mike Gore, Drew Sullivan, Tom Dressing, David (Collier-)  Brown, Karen Banks, (1986) Michael Smith, Rita Khan, Pete Sketch, (1991) Phil Roach, Mike King, Mike Young, J Raymond, Vassil Stoilov, George Georiev.

==A Windows Version?==
In the early 1990s, some thought was given to making a Windows version of Ability Plus, but the difficulties in fashioning a Windows program from DOS code led to the decision to start from scratch. The outcome of this line of development was [[Ability Office]], and although it shares no source code with the Ability Plus, an attempt was made to follow some of the design principles of the original such as shared code and a common recalculation engine.

<title>Ablative case</title>
<text>{{about||the physical process|Ablation|the spacecraft technology|Ablative armor}}

In [[linguistics]], '''ablative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''abl'''}}) is a name given to [[grammatical case|cases]] in various languages whose common characteristic is that they mark motion away from something, though the details in each language may differ. The name "ablative" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ablatus'', the (irregular) perfect passive participle of ''auferre'' "to carry away".

==Indo-European languages==
===Latin===
{{Main|Ablative (Latin)}}
The [[Latin]] ablative case (''ablativus'')is mainly used [[adverb]]ially to modify [[verb]]s. It has 15 uses, descending from three [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at). The ablative is sometimes called the [[adverbial case]], since phrases in the ablative can be translated as [[adverb]]s: ''magnā (cum) celeritāte'' can be translated as "with great speed" or "very quickly."

===Greek===
In [[Ancient Greek]], the functions of the ablative case were taken by the [[genitive case|genitive]], so that the genitive has functions belonging to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] genitive and ablative cases.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. par. 1279: composite or mixed cases.</ref> The genitive case with the prepositions ἀπό ''apó'' "away from" and ἐκ/ἐξ ''ek/ex'' "out of" is an example.

===Albanian===
The ablative case is found in Albanian where it is the fifth case and is called "mënyra rrjedhore."

===Sanskrit===
The ablative case in Sanskrit is the fifth case (panchami) in the grammar, and has similar function to that of Latin.  

Sanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject "out of" which or "from" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred. 

E.g. ''patram '''vrikshaat''' patati'' "the leaf falls '''from the tree'''".

This case is also used for nouns in several other senses, eg, where the action occurs "because of" or "without" a certain noun; nouns indicating distance or direction.

===Armenian===
In the Western Armenian language, the ablative case is rendered by the suffix ''-e'' (indefinite) or ''-en'' (definite).

:''Mart'' - man
:''Marten'' - from the man
:''Marte'' - from (a) man

:''Doon'' - house
:''D'nen'' - from the house
:''D'ne'' - from (a) house

In Eastern Armenian, the suffix ''-its'' is used for both definite and indefinite nouns.

''Mard-'' man  
''Mardits-'' from man

''Toon-'' house 
''T'nits-'' from house

Both suffixes are derived from Classical Armenian. The Western suffix ''-e'' is from the Classical singular and the Eastern suffix ''-its'' is from the Classical plural; both have been generalized for singular and plural in the dialects that use them.

In Armenian, the ablative case has several uses.
*Its principal function is to show motion away from a point in space or time.
**''KAGHAKEN katsi.''  -  I came FROM THE CITY. (Eastern Armenian;  ''KAGHAKITS gnets'')
**''ASTEGHEN heroo g'abrei.''  -  I used to live far FROM HERE.  (Ea.  ''ASTEGHITS heroo ei b'nakvoom'')

*The case also shows the agent when used with the passive voice of the verb.
**''INE misht g' sirveis.''  -  You were always loved BY ME.   (Ea. ''INDZITS misht eis sirvoom'')
**''AZAD'CHNEREN azadetsank.''  -  We were freed BY THE LIBERATORS. (Ea.  ''AZATOGHNERITS azatfetsink'')

*The ablative case is also important to comparative statements in colloquial Armenian.
**''Inch MEGHREN anoosh eh?''  -  "What is sweeter THAN HONEY?" (proverb)   (Ea.  ''Inch MEGHRITS e anoosh?'')
**''Mariam EKHPEREN b'zdig eh.''  -  Mary is smaller (younger) THAN HER BROTHER.  (Ea.  ''Maro AKHBERITS e bakas'')
**In this use, the ablative can also be used with infinitives and participles.
***''Tooz hamdesel e lav DESNALE.''  -  Figs are better to taste THAN TO SEE.  (Ea.  ''T'zner hamtesel e laf TESNELITS'')

*The ablative case is also important to case government with postpositions.
**''INE var''  -   Below ME  (Ea.  ''INDZITS var'')
**''KEZME ver'' -  Above YOU  (Ea.  ''KEZITS ver'')
**''ANONTSME verch'' - After THEM   (Ea.  ''N'RANITS verj'')
**''MEZME arach'' -  Before US   (Ea.  ''MEZNITS araj'')

==Uralic languages==
===Finnish===
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning "from, off, of", e.g. ''pöytä – pöydältä'' "table – off from the table". It is an outer locative case, used just as the [[adessive]] and [[allative]] cases to denote both being on top of something and "being around the place" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the [[elative]], which means "from out of" or "from the inside of"). In the locative meaning, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.

The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.

The Finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltä according to the regular rules of [[vowel harmony]].

Usage

* away from a place

::Katolta
:::Off the roof

::Pöydältä
:::Off the table

::Rannalta
:::From the beach

::Maalta
:::From the land

::Mereltä
:::From the sea

* to stop some activity with the verb lähteä

::lähteä tupakalta
:::stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now; literally 'leave from the tobacco')
::lähteä hippasilta
:::stop playing the game of tag (hippa=tag, olla hippasilla=playing tag)

* to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something

::haisee pahalta
:::smells bad
::maistuu hyvältä
:::tastes good
::tuntuu kamalalta
:::feels awful
::näyttää tyhmältä
:::looks stupid
::kuulostaa mukavalta
:::sounds nice

===Hungarian===
The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe '''movement away from a solid object'''.  For example, if one is walking away from a friend one could say: 
''a barátom'''tól''' jövök'' - I am coming (away from) my friend.

Note that this case in this example implies that the user was ''next to'' the solid object, and not inside it.  This means that if one said
''a postától jövök'' it would mean one is coming from being stood ''next to'' the post office, and that you were not inside the building. 

The application of [[vowel harmony]] gives two different suffixes:  '''-tól''' and '''-től'''.  These are applied to back- and front-vowel words respectively.

Its partners for movement towards a solid object and for being next to that solid object are the [[allative case]] and the [[adessive case]] respectively.   Its partners that correspond to movement away from, or out of, something are the [[delative case]] (for movement from a surface or from a Hungarian city) and the [[elative case]] (for movement out of a container or from out of an international city).

==Altaic languages==
===Azeri===

The ablative in [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] (''{{Lang|az|çıxışlıq hal}}'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-dan'' or ''-dən''. Examples:

Ev - ev'''dən'''
<br/>''House - from/off the house''

Aparmaq - aparmaq'''dan'''
<br/>''To carry - from/off carrying''

===Turkish===
The ablative in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (''-den hali'' or ''uzaklaşma hali'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-den'', ''-dan'', ''-ten'', or ''-tan''. Examples:

Ev - ev'''den'''
<br/>''House - from/off the house''

At - at'''tan'''
<br/>''Horse - from/off the horse''

Taşımak - taşımak'''tan'''
<br/>''To carry - from/off carrying''

Ses - ses'''ten'''
<br/>''Sound/volume - from/off sound/volume''

<br/>In some situations simple ablative can have a ”because of” meaning, in this situations ablative + ”dolayı” (because of) preposition is optional. 

Yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. /  ''I was uneasy because of high volume. ''

<title>About Time (book)</title>
<text>{{unsourced|date=September 2010}}
'''''About Time''''' (ISBN 0-684-81822-1) is the second [[book]] written by [[Paul Davies]], regarding the subject of [[time]].  The intended audience is the general public, rather than science academics.

''About Time'' explores selected mysteries of [[spacetime]], following on from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which Davies believes does not fully explain time as humans experience it. The author explains <blockquote>
Important though Einstein's time turned out to be, it still did not solve "the riddle of time".
</blockquote>

The book delves into the nature of [[metaphysics]], time, motion and [[gravity]], covering a wide range of aspects surrounding the current [[cosmological]] [[debate]], across 283 pages in great detail. It includes an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a [[bibliography]], and numerous [[diagram]]s.

<title>Aboutness</title>
<text>{{Citation style}}
'''Aboutness''' is a term used in library and information science (LIS), linguistics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. In LIS, it is often considered synonymous with [[subject (discourse)]]. In philosophy it has been often considered synonymous with [[intentionality]], perhaps since [[John Searle]] (1983). 

R. A. Fairthorne (1969) is credited with coining the exact term "aboutness," which became popular in LIS since the late 1970s, perhaps due to arguments put forward by [[William John Hutchins]] (1975, 1977, 1978). Hutchins argued that "aboutness" was to be preferred to "subject" because it removed some epistemological problems. Hjørland (1992, 1997) argued, however, that the same epistemological problems also were present in Hutchins's proposal, why "aboutness" and "subject" should be considered synonymous. 

While information scientists may well be concerned with the literary aboutness (John Hutchins, 1975, 1977, 1978), philosophers of mind and psychologists with the psychological or [[intentionality|intentional]] aboutness (John Searle, 1983) and [[language of thought]] (Jerry Fodor, 1975), and [[semantic externalism|semantic externalists]] with the external state of affairs (Hilary Putnam, 1975). These seminal perspectives are respectively analogous to [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards]]' ''literary, psychological, and external contexts'' (1923), as well as [[Karl Popper]]'s ''World 1, 2, and 3 (1977). 

In linguistics, aboutness is simply meaning, the end of language. In psychology, it is [[intentionality]]. In [[psycholinguistics]] or [[cognitive linguistics]], it is [[language of thought]] in vogue, or something like that.

'''''Abramowitz and Stegun''''' is the informal name of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] reference work edited by [[Milton Abramowitz]] and [[Irene Stegun]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now the ''National Institute of Standards and Technology'').  Its full title is '''''Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables'''''.

Since it was first published in 1964, the 1046 page ''Handbook'' has been one of the most comprehensive sources of information on [[special function]]s, containing definitions, identities, approximations, plots, and tables of values of numerous functions used in virtually all fields of [[applied mathematics]].  The notation used in the ''Handbook'' is the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for much of applied mathematics today.

At the time of its publication, the ''Handbook'' was an essential resource for practitioners.  Nowadays, [[computer algebra system]]s have replaced the [[mathematical table|function tables]], but the ''Handbook'' remains an important reference source.  The foreword discusses a meeting in 1954 in which it was agreed that "''the advent of high-speed computing equipment changed the task of table making but definitely did not remove the need for tables''".

{{cquote| More than 1,000 pages long, the ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions'' was first published in 1964 and reprinted many times, with yet another reprint in 1999. Its influence on science and engineering is evidenced by its popularity. In fact, when ''New Scientist'' magazine recently asked some of the world’s leading scientists what single book they would want if stranded on a desert island, one distinguished British physicist<ref>[[Michael Berry]], [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15621095.500-christmas-books-----or-maybe-two-or-three---.html New Scientist 22 November 1997]</ref> said he would take the Handbook.
The ''Handbook'' is likely the most widely distributed and most cited NIST technical publication of all time. Government sales exceed 150,000 copies, and an estimated three times as many have been reprinted and sold by commercial publishers since 1965. During the mid-1990s, the book was cited every 1.5 hours of each working day. And its influence will persist as it is currently being updated in digital format by NIST.|4=[[NIST]]<ref>NIST at 100: Foundations for Progress, 1964:Mathematics Handbook Becomes Best Seller — http://www.100.nist.gov/ph_spaceage.htm</ref>}}

==Editions==
Because the ''Handbook'' is the work of [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] employees acting in their official capacity, it is [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|not protected by copyright]].  While it can be ordered from the [[Government Printing Office]], it has also been reprinted by commercial publishers, most notably [[Dover Publications]] (ISBN 0-486-61272-4), and can be legally viewed and downloaded off the web.

==Successor==
A digital successor to the Handbook, long under development at NIST, was released as the “[[Digital library of mathematical functions]]” (DLMF) on May 11, 2010, along with a printed version, the ''NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions,'' published by [[Cambridge University Press]].(ISBN 9780521192255).

'''Access-eGov''' (''Access to e-Government Services Employing Semantic Technologies'') is a 36-month [[STReP]] research and development project, co-funded by the [[European Commission]] within the [[FP6|Sixth Framework Programme]] under the Information Society Technologies (IST) priority, contract No. FP6-2004-27020. This project addresses the strategic objective SO 2.4.13 ''Strengthening the Integration of the ICT research effort in an Enlarged Europe'' <ref>SO 2.4.13 ''Strengthening the Integration of the ICT research effort in an Enlarged Europe'' http://cordis.europa.eu/ist/workprogramme/wp0506_en/2_4_13.htm</ref>.

The Access-eGov project <ref>ICT Results: Access-eGov success story. 28. June 2007 http://cordis.europa.eu/ictresults/index.cfm/section/news/tpl/article/BrowsingType/Features/ID/89095</ref> is aiming at the development and validation of the platform for composition of government services into process definitions, enabling [[Semantic interoperability]] of particular [[e-Government]] services. The solution is based on the [[Semantic technology|semantic technologies]] as enhanced [[WSMO|WSMO conceptual framework]], [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]] [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]], semantic [[annotation]] of services, their [[Web Services Discovery|discovery]], [[Service_Oriented_Programming#Service_Implementation:_Composite_Service|composition]], [[Data mediation|mediation]], and executing in the [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] environment. Adopting a citizen-centric approach <ref>Anamarija Leben, Mirko Vintar: ''Life-Event Approach: Comparison between Countries''. In: Electronic Government. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 2739/2003, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, p. 1057, ISBN 978-3-540-40845-9. http://www.springerlink.com/content/0cnyub02gf5c45lj/</ref>, Access-eGov customises the [[workflow]] of electronic and traditional (i.e. face-to-face) services according to the personal needs of each citizen.

==Background, motivation==
The Access-eGov project is motivated by the needs to increase the [[interoperability]] of existing governmental services in existing or newly created e-Government solutions on local, national, and Pan-European levels. The interoperability was recognised as a precondition for the implementation of European eGovernment services in the ''eEurope Action Plan 2005'' <ref>eEurope Action Plan 2005 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/2005/all_about/action_plan/index_en.htm</ref> and is explicitly addressed as one of the four main challenges in the [[I2010|I2010 EU strategy]]. It is recommended to build the solutions supporting interoperability of governmental services on standards, open specifications and open interfaces <ref>Commission of the European Communities, Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Interoperability for Pan-European eGovernment Services. Brussels, 13.2.2006. http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=24117</ref>.

From the three aspects of [[interoperability]] (i.e. ''organisational'', ''semantic'', and ''technical'' <ref>Commission of the European Communities, Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Interoperability for Pan-European eGovernment Services. Brussels, 13.2.2006. Page 6. http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=24117</ref>), the Access-eGov project is particularly focused on the semantic interoperability. The central idea is to ensure that the meaning of the shared and exchanged information is captured, formalised, and is understood in the same way by the people, applications, and institutions involved in the eGovernment solution. It can be achieved by enriching the provided governmental services and other information resources with a machine-readable [[Annotation|semantic description]], applying the [[Semantic technology|semantic technologies]] as shared domain ontologies, formal ontology languages (e.g. [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], [[OWL]], [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]]), [[Semantic Web Services]] and corresponding frameworks as e.g. [[RDF Schema|RDF-S]], [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]], [[OWL-S]], and [[WSMO]] (see also the list of [[#Related_Projects|Related projects]]). Within the Access-eGov, the [[WSMO|WSMO framework]] was selected as a basic implementation platform.

==Access-eGov approach, objectives and solution==
The project objectives were defined on organisational and technological levels. Main ''organisational objective'' is to improve [[accessibility]] and [[connectivity]] of governmental services for citizens and businesses. ''Technical objectives'' are focused on the development of the [[software platform]] and tools for integration of various types of governmental services on a semantic basis, including a [[methodology]] for maintenance of the solution by public administrations.

A resource WSML [[ontology]] covering basic [[Domain knowledge]] and processes for locating and contracting e-Government services was created for the three [[#Pilot_Applications|pilot applications]] of the project. The requirement-driven approach <ref name="Ralf Klischewski 2007, pp. 133-140">Ralf Klischewski, Stefan Ukena: ''Designing semantic e-Government services driven by user requirements''. In: Electronic Government, 6th International EGOV Conference. Proceedings of ongoing research, project contributions and workshops (3–6 September 2007, Regensburg, Germany). Trauner Verlag, Linz, Austria, 2007, pp. 133–140, ISBN 978-3-85499-255-4</ref> was used by public administrations to describe the services, goals, and scenarios. The core Access-eGov system was implemented as an extension of the [[WSMO]] conceptual model <ref>Mach, M., Bednár, P., Hreňo, J.: Execution and composition of government services. 
In: MeTTeG07 : Methodologies, Technologies and Tool enabling e-Government. Proceedings of the 1st International Conference : Camerino, Italy – 27–28 September 2007. Matelica : Halley Editrice, 2007. pp.139–153. ISBN 978-88-7589-300-2.</ref>. The solution includes two client side tools – ''Personal Assistant client'', which provides browsing of the scenarios and services for citizens, and ''Annotation tool'' enabling semantic annotation of services for public administrations.

The Access-eGov solution was tested within the first trial in autumn 2007 <ref>ePractice.eu: Access-eGov completes first pilot trials. 11 April 2008. http://www.epractice.eu/document/4562</ref>. Results of the testing were evaluated and were taken as a background for further improvements. Currently (second half of year 2008) the Access-eGov project approaches its final phase, which includes second trial of all the pilot applications and final evaluation of achieved results.

==Pilot Applications==
===German field test – "Getting married" scenario===
The field test was carried out by Ministry of Finance of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. It was focused on the life event "marriage" and related procedures. The [[Registration of births, deaths and marriages|registry offices]] of eleven municipalities from Schleswig-Holstein have been involved in this field test. The main aim was to test the integration of different web resources containing the service information and making them accessible via a single platform but still leaving the data and its maintenance in the municipalities' legacy systems.

===Slovak pilot – "Obtaining a building permission" scenario===
The pilot application has been carried out by the [[Kosice Self-governing Region|Košice Self-Governing Region]] and the municipality of [[Michalovce]]. It was focused on supporting citizens during the process of obtaining a [[Building permit]], including complex services related to [[Land-use planning]] and approval proceedings. The objective was to make the whole process easier and transparent for citizens, to provide all relevant information about necessary services in a comprehensive and user-friendly way, and finally to improve the service from the citizen's point of view.

===Polish pilot – "Establishing an enterprise" scenario===
The pilot application took place in the Silesian region and was performed by the [[Gliwice]] City Hall. The user scenario involved four main user goals: registration in local government, registration in statistical office, registration in [[tax]] office and registration in [[Social insurance]] agency. The objective of the pilot application was to provide a single entry point where users (citizens and entrepreneurs) can obtain relevant information and are properly navigated by the system within the whole complex process.

This approach provides a generic method how to collect, relate, and formally express the information needs of the public administrations, as service providers, to design the specific semantic structures and descriptions of provided governmental services.
* ''Resource [[Ontology|ontologies]]'', proposed as the specification of system data for the services and workflow structures within the Access-eGov system.<ref>D7.1 Public administration resource ontologies. Access-eGov project, Public Deliverable. 30 November 2007. http://www.accessegov.org/acegov/uploadedFiles/webfiles/cffile_2_20_08_5_50_43_PM.zip</ref>
* Tools:
** ''Annotation tool'', which provides for public administration officers a capability to semantically annotate the resources as services, contact data, working hours, fees, etc. A set of forms and templates was designed for specification of preconditions and non-functional properties as parameters of the annotated government services, which can then be grouped into complex workflow sequences. The tool is designed as a standard web application, using the extended WSMO object model and [[JavaServer Faces|JSF]] technology.
** ''Personal Assistant client'', a tool that provides browsing, discovery, and execution capabilities of the services for citizens and businesses according to a specified life event or goal. Users can browse sub-goals and provide their answers when customization input is requested. Then the system automatically resolves the sub-goals and navigates the user to a new set of sub-goals and services inferred from the conceptual model. The electronic services provided via standardized [[Web Service]] interface can be directly invoked. Finally, the citizen obtains all available information on the life event customized to his/her case, and has also the possibility to execute the actions required for particular services needed for the accomplishing of the life event. The Personal Assistant client was implemented as a web application using [[JavaServer Faces|JSF]] technology. Layout, structure, and ordering of tabs in the interface are dynamically created from the annotated services and are customized according to the conditions of the given user.

<title>Access control vestibule</title>
<text>The '''Access Control Vestibule''' (ACV) is a [[security]] screening system for the [[detection]] of individuals carrying [[weapons]] into any facility without [[authorization]], therefore minimizing the possibility of an [[armed]] takeover. The ACV is composed of an [[aluminum]] frame, separate entrance and exit doors, a [[metal detection]] system, and [[bullet-proof glass]]. If a weapon is detected, the doors to the ACV automatically lock.<ref>http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5992094.html</ref> The ACV is typically used in [[bank]]s and other secure facilities.<ref>http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2007/06/18/daily18.html?from_rss=1</ref>

== Patent ==
Novacomm, Inc. patented the ACV in 1994.

== Technology ==
The ACV incorporates several [[security]] [[technologies]] that security [[personnel]] can use to assist with the [[screening]] process. Included are: 1) an [[intercom]] for communications; 2) optional [[camera]] so personnel can see the individual requesting [[access]]; 3) [[metal detector]] to ferret out any [[weapons]] that may be present on the individual requesting access; and 4) [[access control]] for physical access to the business. When a customer enters the vestibule a passive [[infrared detector]] senses that someone is present within the enclosure, locking the doors behind and in front of him/her, thus forming a [[mantrap]]. The door behind the person is locked to prevent [[Piggybacking (security)|piggybacking]]. Both doors are secured using [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] locks. At no time is the person inside the entrance of the [[mantrap]] prevented from leaving through the door they first entered, but the inside door to the inner sanctum of the business cannot be opened until the [[metal detector]] has determined that no weapons are present.<ref>http://www.securitysales.com/t_news_print.aspx?action=article&amp;storyID=3237</ref>

<title>Access structure</title>
<text>'''Access structures''' are used in the study of security system where multiple parties need to work together to obtain a resource. Groups of parties that are granted access are called qualified. In [[set theory|set theoretic]] terms they are referred to as qualified sets. In turn, the set of all such qualified sets is called the access structure of the system. Less formally it is a description of who needs to cooperate with whom in order to access the resource. In its original use in [[cryptography]], the resource was a secret [[secret sharing|shared]] among the participants. Only subgroups of participants contained in the access structure, are able to join their shares to recompute the secret. More generally, the resource can also be a task that a group of people can complete together, such as creating a [[digital signature]], or decrypting an encrypted message.

It is reasonable to assume that access structures are [[monotone]] in the sense that, if a subset S is in the access structure, all sets that contain S as a subset should also form part of the access structure.

<title>Access token</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=August 2010}}
In [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, an '''access token''' contains the security information for a [[login session]] and identifies the [[user (computing)|user]], the user's groups, and the user's privileges.

==Overview==
An ''access token'' is an [[Object Manager (Windows)|object]] encapsulating the [[security descriptor]] of a [[Process (computing)|process]].<ref name="atoken">{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa374909.aspx | title = Access Tokens | publisher = [[MSDN]] | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> Attached to a process, a security descriptor identifies the owner of the object (in this case, the process) and [[Access Control List|ACL]]s that specifies accessing rights allowed or denied to the owner of the object.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379563.aspx | title = Security Descriptors | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379557.aspx | title = Securable Objects | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> While a token is used to represent only the security information, it is technically free-form and can enclose any data. The access token is used by Windows when the process or thread tries to interact with objects whose security descriptors enforce access control (''securable objects'').<ref name="atoken"/> An access token is represented by the [[Object Manager (Windows)|system object]] of type <code>Token</code>. Because a token is a regular system object, access to a token itself can be [[access control|controlled]] by attaching a [[security descriptor]], but it is generally never done in practice.

The access token is generated by the [[login|logon]] service when a user logs on to the system and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database, by specifying the rights the user has in the [[security descriptor]] enclosed by the token. The token is attached to every process created by the user session (processes whose owner is the user).<ref name="atoken"/> Whenever such a process accesses any resource which has [[access control]] enabled, Windows looks up in the security descriptor in the access token whether the user owning the process is eligible to access the data, and if so, what operations (read, write/modify, etc.) the user is allowed to do. If the accessing operation is allowed in the context of the user, Windows allows the process to continue with the operation, else it is denied access.

==Types of tokens==
There are two types of tokens:
;Primary token: Primary tokens can only be associated to [[Process (computing)|processes]], and they represent a process's security subject. The creation of primary tokens and their association to processes are both privileged operations, requiring two different privileges in the name of [[privilege separation]] - the typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token, and a logon service associating it to the user's [[operating system shell]]. Processes initially inherit a copy of the parent process's primary token. Impersonation tokens can only be associated to [[thread (computer science)|threads]], and they represent a ''client'' process's security subject. Impersonation tokens are usually created and associated to the current thread implicitly, by [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] mechanisms such as DCE [[Remote procedure call|RPC]], [[Dynamic Data Exchange|DDE]] and [[named pipe]]s.

;Impersonation token: Impersonation is a security concept unique to Windows NT, that allows a server application to temporarily "be" the client in terms of access to secure objects. Impersonation has three possible levels: ''identification'', letting the server inspect the client's identity, ''impersonation'', letting the server act on behalf of the client, and ''delegation'', same as impersonation but extended to remote systems to which the server connects (through the preservation of credentials). The client can choose the maximum impersonation level (if any) available to the server as a connection parameter. Delegation and impersonation are privileged operations (impersonation initially wasn't, but historical carelessness in the implementation of client [[application programming interface|API]]s failing to restrict the default level to "identification", letting an unprivileged server impersonate an unwilling privileged client, called for it).

==Contents of a token==
A token is composed of various fields, including but not limited to:
* an identifier.
* the identifier of the associated logon session. The session is maintained by the authentication service, and is populated by the authentication packages with a collection of all the information ([[credentials]]) the user provided when logging in. Credentials are used to access remote systems without the need for the user to re-authenticate ([[single sign-on]]), provided that all the systems involved share an authentication authority (e.g. a [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] ticket server)
* the user identifier. This field is the most important and it's strictly read-only.
* the identifiers of groups the user (or, more precisely, the subject) is part of. Group identifiers cannot be deleted, but they can be disabled. At most one of the groups is designated as the ''session id'', a volatile group representing the logon session, allowing access to volatile objects associated to the session, such as the display.
* the restricting group identifiers (optional). This additional set of groups doesn't grant additional access, but further restricts it: access to an object is only allowed if it's allowed ''also'' to one of these groups. Restricting groups cannot be deleted nor disabled. Restricting groups are a recent addition, and they are used in the implementation of [[sandbox (security)|sandboxes]].
* the privileges, i.e. special capabilities the user has. Most privileges are disabled by default, to prevent damage from non-security-conscious programs. Starting in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 privileges can be permanently removed from a token by a call to <code>AdjustTokenPrivileges()</code> with the <code>SE_PRIVILEGE_REMOVED</code> attribute.
* the default owner, primary group and ACL for objects created by the subject associated to the token.

<title>Accounting method</title>
<text>{{dablink|For accounting methods in business and financial reporting, see [[Accounting methods]].}}
In the field of [[analysis of algorithms]] in [[computer science]], the '''accounting method''' is a method of [[amortized analysis]] based on [[accounting]].  The accounting method often gives a more intuitive account of the amortized cost of an operation than either [[aggregate analysis]] or the [[potential method]].  Note, however, that this does not guarantee such analysis will be immediately obvious; often, choosing the correct parameters for the accounting method requires as much knowledge of the problem and the complexity bounds one is attempting to prove as the other two methods.

The accounting method is most naturally suited for proving a [[Big O notation|O]](1) bound on time.  The method as explained here is for proving such a bound.

==The method==

Preliminarily, we choose a set of elementary operations which will be used in the [[algorithm]], and arbitrarily set their cost to 1.  The fact that the costs of these operations may in reality differ presents no difficulty in principle.  What is important, is that each elementary operation has a constant cost.

Each aggregate operation is assigned a "payment".  The payment is intended to cover the cost of elementary operations needed to complete this particular operation, with some of the payment left over, placed in a pool to be used later.

The difficulty with problems that require amortized analysis is that, in general, some of the operations will require greater than constant cost.  This means that no constant payment will be enough to cover the worst case cost of an operation, in and of itself.  With proper selection of payment, however, this is no longer a difficulty; the expensive operations will only occur when there is sufficient payment in the pool to cover their costs.

==Examples==

A few examples will help to illustrate the use of the accounting method.

===Table expansion===

It is often necessary to create a table before it is known how much space is needed.  One possible strategy is to double the size of the table when it is full.  Here we will use the accounting method to show that the amortized cost of an insertion operation in such a table is [[O]](1).

Before looking at the procedure in detail, we need some definitions.  Let T be a table, E an element to insert, num(T) the number of elements in T, and size(T) the allocated size of T.  We assume the existence of operations create_table(n), which creates an empty table of size n, for now assumed to be free, and elementary_insert(T,E), which inserts element E into a table T that already has space allocated, with a cost of 1.

The following [[pseudocode]] illustrates the table insertion procedure:
  '''function''' table_insert(T,E)
      '''if''' num(T) = size(T)
          U := create_table(2 &amp;times; size(T))
          '''for each''' F '''in''' T
              elementary_insert(U,F)
          T := U
      elementary_insert(T,E)

Without amortized analysis, the best bound we can show for n insert operations is O(n<sup>2</sup>) &amp;mdash; this is due to the loop at line 4 that performs num(T) elementary insertions.

For analysis using the accounting method, we assign a payment of 3 to each table insertion.  Although the reason for this is not clear now, it will become clear during the course of the analysis.

Assume that initially the table is empty with size(T) = m.  The first m insertions therefore do not require reallocation and only have cost 1 (for the elementary insert).  Therefore, when num(T) = m, the pool has (3 - 1)&amp;times;m = 2m.

Inserting element m + 1 requires reallocation of the table.  Creating the new table on line 3 is free (for now).  The loop on line 4 requires m elementary insertions, for a cost of m.  Including the insertion on the last line, the total cost for this operation is m + 1.  After this operation, the pool therefore has 2m + 3 - (m + 1) = m + 2.

Next, we add another m - 1 elements to the table.  At this point the pool has m + 2 + 2&amp;times;(m - 1) = 3m.  Inserting an additional element (that is, element 2m + 1) can be seen to have cost 2m + 1 and a payment of 3.  After this operation, the pool has 3m + 3 - (2m + 1) = m + 2.  Note that this is the same amount as after inserting element m + 1.  In fact, we can show that this will be the case for any number of reallocations.

It can now be made clear why the payment for an insertion is 3.  1 goes to inserting the element the first time it is added to the table, 1 goes to moving it the next time the table is expanded, and 1 goes to moving one of the elements that was already in the table the next time the table is expanded.

We initially assumed that creating a table was free.  In reality, creating a table of size n may be as expensive as O(n).  Let us say that the cost of creating a table of size n is n.  Does this new cost present a difficulty?  Not really; it turns out we use the same method to show the amortized O(1) bounds.  All we have to do is change the payment.

When a new table is created, there is an old table with m entries.  The new table will be of size 2m.  As long as the entries currently in the table have added enough to the pool to pay for creating the new table, we will be all right.

We cannot expect the first <math>\frac{m}{2}</math> entries to help pay for the new table.  Those entries already paid for the current table.  We must then rely on the last <math>\frac{m}{2}</math> entries to pay the cost <math>2m</math>.  This means we must add <math>\frac{2m}{m/2} = 4</math> to the payment for each entry, for a total payment of 3 + 4 = 7.

<title>Accuracy paradox</title>
<text>{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
The '''accuracy paradox''' for [[predictive analytics]] states that predictive models with a given level of [[accuracy]] may have greater [[predictive power]] than models with higher accuracy. It may be better to avoid the accuracy metric in favor of other metrics such as [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] and [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]].   

Accuracy is often the starting point for analyzing the quality of a predictive model, as well as an obvious criterion for prediction. Accuracy measures the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of cases evaluated. It may seem obvious that the ratio of correct predictions to cases should be a key metric. A predictive model may have high accuracy, but be useless.

In an example predictive model for an [[insurance fraud]] application, all cases that are predicted as high-risk by the model will be investigated. To evaluate the performance of the model, the insurance company has created a sample data set of 10,000 claims. All 10,000 cases in the [[validation]] sample have been carefully checked and it is known which cases are fraudulent. To analyze the quality of the model, the insurance uses the [[table of confusion]].  The definition of accuracy, the table of confusion for model M<sub>1</sub><sup>Fraud</sup>, and the calculation of accuracy for model M<sub>1</sub><sup>Fraud</sup> is shown below.

<math>\mathrm{A}(M) = \frac{TN + TP}{TN + FP + FN + TP}</math>
where
: TN is the number of true negative cases
: FP is the number of false positive cases
: FN is the number of false negative cases
: TP is the number of true positive cases

<math>\mathrm A (M) = \frac{9,700 + 100}{9,700 + 150 + 50 + 100} = 98.0%</math>

''Formula 2: Accuracy for model M<sub>1</sub><sup>Fraud</sup>''

With an accuracy of 98.0% model M<sub>1</sub><sup>Fraud</sup> appears to perform fairly well. The paradox lies in the fact that accuracy can be easily improved to 98.5% by always predicting "no fraud". The table of confusion and the accuracy for this trivial “always predict negative” model M<sub>2</sub><sup>Fraud</sup> and the accuracy of this model are shown below.

{|class="prettytable"

<math>\mathrm{A}(M) = \frac{9,850 + 0}{9,850 + 150 + 0 + 0} = 98.5%</math>

''Formula 3: Accuracy for model M<sub>2</sub><sup>Fraud</sup>''

Model M<sub>2</sub><sup>Fraud</sup>reduces the rate of inaccurate predictions from 2% to 1.5%. This is an apparent improvement of 25%. The new model M<sub>2</sub><sup>Fraud</sup> shows fewer incorrect predictions and markedly improved accuracy, as compared to the original model M<sub>1</sub><sup>Fraud</sup>, but is obviously useless. 

The alternative model M<sub>2</sub><sup>Fraud</sup> does not offer any value to the company for preventing fraud. The less accurate model is more useful than the more accurate model.  

Model improvements should not be measured in terms of accuracy gains. It may be going too far to say that accuracy is irrelevant, but caution is advised when using accuracy in the evaluation of predictive models.

<title>Ackermann function</title>
<text>In [[computability theory]], the '''Ackermann function''', named after [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] that is not [[Primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

After Ackermann's publication<ref name="Ack">{{cite journal | author=Wilhelm Ackermann | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | title=''Zum Hilbertschen Aufbau der reellen Zahlen'' | year=1928 | volume=99 | pages=118–133 | doi=10.1007/BF01459088}}</ref> of his function (which had three nonnegative integer arguments), many authors modified it to suit various purposes, so that today "the Ackermann function" may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function. One common version, the two-argument '''Ackermann–Péter function''', is defined as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'':

:<math> A(m, n) =
\begin{cases}
n+1 &amp; \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
A(m-1, 1) &amp; \mbox{if } m &amp;gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) &amp; \mbox{if } m &amp;gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n &amp;gt; 0.
\end{cases}
</math>

Its value grows rapidly, even for small inputs.  For example ''A''(4,2) is an integer of 19,729 decimal digits.<ref>[http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html Decimal expansion of A(4,2)] {{Wayback|url=http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html|date =20080317104411}}</ref>

==History==
In the late 1920s, the mathematicians [[Gabriel Sudan]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], students of [[David Hilbert]], were studying the foundations of computation.  Both Sudan and Ackermann are credited<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cristian Calude, [[Solomon Marcus]] and Ionel Tevy | journal = Historia Math. | title=The first example of a recursive function which is not primitive recursive | month=November | year=1979 | pages=380–84 | volume=6 | issue=4 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(79)90024-7}}</ref> with discovering [[total function|total]] [[computable function]]s (termed simply "recursive" in some references) that are not [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]].  Sudan published the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function <math>\phi\,\!</math>.  Ackermann's three-argument function, <math>\phi(m, n, p)\,\!</math>, is defined such that for ''p'' = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation as
:<math>\phi(m, n, 0) = m+n,\,\!</math>
:<math>\phi(m, n, 1) = m\cdot n,\,\!</math>
:<math>\phi(m, n, 2) = m^n,\,\!</math>
and for ''p'' &amp;gt; 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that happens to be expressible in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] as
:<math>\phi(m, n, p) = m\uparrow^{p - 1}(n + 1)\,\!</math>.
(Aside from its historic role as a total-computable-but-not-primitive-recursive function, Ackermann's original function is seen to extend the basic arithmetic operations beyond exponentiation, although not as seamlessly as do variants of Ackermann's function that are specifically designed for that purpose — such as [[Reuben Goodstein|Goodstein's]] [[hyperoperation]] sequence.)

In ''On the Infinite'', David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert’s personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper ''On Hilbert’s Construction of the Real Numbers''. ''On the Infinite'' was Hilbert’s most important paper on the foundations of mathematics, serving as the heart of [[Hilbert's program]] to secure the foundation of [[transfinite number]]s by basing them on finite methods.<ref name="Ack"/><ref>von Heijenoort. [http://mathgate.info/cebrown/notes/vonHeijenoort.php From Frege To Gödel], 1967.</ref>

[[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Raphael Robinson]] later developed a two-variable version of the Ackermann function that became preferred by many authors.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Raphael M. Robinson | title=Recursion and Double Recursion | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | year=1948 | volume=54 | pages=987–93 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183512393&amp;page=record | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1948-09121-2}}</ref>

==Definition and properties==
Ackermann's original three-argument function <math>\phi(m, n, p)\,\!</math> is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'', ''n'', and ''p'':

:<math> \begin{cases}
\phi(m, n, 0) = m + n \\
\phi(m, 0, 1) = 0 \\
\phi(m, 0, 2) = 1 \\
\phi(m, 0, p) = m \text{ for } p &amp;gt; 2 \\
\phi(m, n, p) = \phi(m, \phi(m, n-1, p), p - 1) \text{ for } n &amp;gt; 0 \text{ and } p &amp;gt; 0.
\end{cases}\,\!</math>

Of the various two-argument versions, the one developed by Péter and Robinson (called "the" Ackermann function by some authors) is defined for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'' as follows:

:<math> A(m, n) =
\begin{cases}
n+1 &amp; \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
A(m-1, 1) &amp; \mbox{if } m &amp;gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) &amp; \mbox{if } m &amp;gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n &amp;gt; 0.
\end{cases}
</math>

It may not be immediately obvious that the evaluation of <math> A(m, n)</math> always terminates. However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either ''m'' decreases, or ''m'' remains the same and ''n'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' decreases, so ''m'' eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (''m'', ''n'') decreases in the [[lexicographic order]], which preserves the [[well-order]]ing of the non-negative integers.) However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper bound on how much ''n'' can increase — and it will often increase greatly.

The Péter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in terms of various other versions of the Ackermann function:
* the indexed version of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] (extended to integer indices ≥ -2):
::''A''(''m'', ''n'') = <math>2\uparrow^{m-2} (n+3) - 3.</math>
:The part of the definition ''A''(''m'', 0) = A(''m''-1, 1) corresponds to <math>2\uparrow^{m+1} 3=2\uparrow^m 4.</math>

* [[hyper operator]]s:
::''A''(''m'', ''n'') = hyper(2, m, n + 3) − 3.

* [[Conway chained arrow]] notation:
::''A''(''m'', ''n'') = (2 → (''n''+3) → ''(m'' − 2)) − 3 for ''m'' &amp;gt; 2
:hence
::2 → ''n'' → ''m'' = ''A''(''m''+2,''n''-3) + 3 for ''n''>2.
:(''n''=1 and ''n''=2 would correspond with ''A''(''m'',−2) = −1 and ''A''(''m'',−1) = 1, which could logically be added.)

For small values of ''m'' like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to ''n'' (at most [[exponential growth|exponentially]]). For ''m'' ≥ 4, however, it grows much more quickly; even ''A''(4, 2) is about 2{{e|19728}}, and the decimal expansion of ''A''(4, 3) is very large by any typical measure.

If we define the function ''f'' (''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n''), which increases both ''m'' and ''n'' at the same time, we have a function of one variable that dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the [[exponential function]], the factorial function, multi- and [[superfactorial]] functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used).

This extreme growth can be exploited to show that ''f'', which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a [[Turing machine]] and so is a [[computable function]], grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.  In a category with exponentials, using the isomorphism <math>A \times B \rightarrow C \cong A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C)</math> (in computer science, this is called [[currying]]), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:

:<math>
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{Ack}(0) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{Succ} \\
\operatorname{Ack}(m+1) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{Iter}(\operatorname{Ack}(m))
\end{array}
</math>

where ''Succ'' is the usual [[successor function]] and ''Iter'' is defined by primitive recursion as well:

:<math>
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{Iter}(f)(0) &amp; = &amp; f(1) \\
\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n+1) &amp; = &amp; f(\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n)).
\end{array}
</math>

One interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.

==Table of values==
Computing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. We place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken. If there is no number to its left, simply look at the column headed "1" in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Values of ''A''(''m'', ''n'')
|-
! ''m''\''n''
! 0
! 1
! 2
! 3
! 4
! n
|-
! 0
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || <math>n + 1</math>
|-
! 1
| 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || <math>n + 2 = 2 + (n + 3) - 3</math>
|-
! 2
| 3 || 5 || 7 || 9 || 11 || <math>2n + 3 = 2\cdot(n + 3) - 3</math>
|-
! 3
| 5 || 13 || 29 || 61 || 125 || <math>2^{(n+3)} - 3</math>
|-
! 4
| 13 || 65533
| 2<sup>65536</sup> − 3
| <math>{2^{2^{65536}}} - 3</math>
| <math>{2^{2^{2^{65536}}}} - 3</math>
| <math>\begin{matrix}\underbrace{{2^2}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^2}}}} - 3 \\n\mbox{ + 3}\end{matrix}</math>
|}

The numbers listed here in a recursive reference are very large and cannot be easily notated in some other form.

Despite the large values occurring in this early section of the table, some even larger numbers have been defined, such as [[Graham's number]], which cannot be written with any small number of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|Knuth arrows]]. This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively.

This is a repeat of the above table, but with the values replaced by the relevant expression from the function definition to show the pattern clearly:

|}



==Expansion==
To see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, we can fully evaluate <math>A(1, 2)</math> in the following way:

:<math>\begin{align}
A(1,2) &amp; = A(0, A(1, 1))       \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, A(1, 0))) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, A(0, 1))) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, 2))       \\
&amp; = A(0, 3)             \\
&amp; = 4.
\end{align}</math>

To demonstrate how <math>A(4, 3)</math>'s computation results in many steps and in a large number:
:<math>\begin{align}
A(4, 3) &amp; = A(3, A(4, 2))                                     \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(4, 1)))                               \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(4, 0))))                         \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(3, 1))))                         \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(3, 0)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(2, 1)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(2, 0))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(1, 1))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))       \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))       \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, 2))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, 3)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(1, 2))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(1, 1)))))))       \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, 2))))))        \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, 3)))))              \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, 4)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, 5))))                         \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, 13)))                              \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, 65533))                                 \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = A(3, 2^{65536} - 3)                               \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = 2^{2^{ \overset{65536}{} }} - 3.                  \\
\end{align}</math>

Written as a power of 10, this is roughly equivalent to 10<sup>6.031{{e|19727}}</sup>.

==Inverse==
Since the function  ''f'' (''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'') considered above grows very rapidly, its [[inverse function]], ''f''<sup>−1</sup>, grows very slowly. This '''inverse Ackermann function''' ''f''<sup>−1</sup> is usually denoted by α. In fact, α(n) is less than 5 for any practical input size ''n'', since A(4, 4) is on the order of <math>2^{2^{10^{19729}}}</math>.

This inverse appears in the time [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of some [[algorithm]]s, such as the [[disjoint-set data structure]] and [[Bernard Chazelle|Chazelle]]'s algorithm for [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates. In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the ''−3'' and similar terms.

A two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows, where <math>\lfloor x \rfloor</math> is the [[floor function]]:
:<math>\alpha(m,n) = \min\{i \geq 1 : A(i,\lfloor m/n \rfloor) \geq \log_2 n\}.</math>
This function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound. In the disjoint-set data structure, ''m'' represents the number of operations while ''n'' represents the number of elements; in the minimum spanning tree algorithm, ''m'' represents the number of edges while ''n'' represents the number of vertices.
Several slightly different definitions of α(''m'', ''n'') exist; for example, log<sub>2</sub> ''n'' is sometimes replaced by ''n'', and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a [[ceiling function|ceiling]].

Other studies might define an inverse function of one where m is set to a constant, such that the inverse applies to a particular row.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15618233 An inverse-Ackermann style lower bound for the online minimum spanning tree verification problem] November 2002</ref>

==Use as benchmark==
The Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion, can be used as a benchmark of a [[compiler]]'s ability to optimize recursion.  The first use of Ackermann's function in this way was by Yngve Sundblad, ''The Ackermann function. A Theoretical, computational and formula manipulative study.'' (BIT 11 (1971), 107119).

This seminal paper was taken up by Brian Wichmann (co-author of the [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone benchmark]]) in a trilogy of papers written between 1975 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ackermann's Function: A Study In The Efficiency Of Calling Procedures | year = 1975 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/ack.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=How to Call Procedures, or Second Thoughts on Ackermann's Function | year = 1977 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/ackpe.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Latest results from the procedure calling test, Ackermann's function | year = 1982 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/acklt.pdf}}</ref>

For example, a compiler which, in analyzing the computation of ''A''(3, 30), is able to save intermediate values like ''A''(3, ''n'') and ''A''(2, ''n'') in that calculation rather than recomputing them, can speed up computation of ''A''(3, 30) by a factor of hundreds of thousands. Also, if ''A''(2, ''n'') is computed directly rather than as a recursive expansion of the form ''A''(1, ''A''(1, ''A''(1,...''A''(1, 0)...))), this will save significant amounts of time. Computing ''A''(1, ''n'') takes linear time in ''n''. Computing ''A''(2, ''n'') requires quadratic time, since it expands to [[Big O notation|O]](''n'') nested calls to ''A''(1, ''i'') for various ''i''. Computing ''A''(3, ''n'') requires time proportionate to 4<sup>''n''+1</sup>. The computation of ''A''(3, 1) in the example above takes 16 (4<sup>2</sup>) steps.

''A''(4, 2), which appears as a decimal expansion in several web pages, cannot possibly be computed by simple recursive application of the Ackermann function in any tractable amount of time. Instead, shortcut formulas such as ''A''(3, ''n'') = 8×2<sup>''n''</sup>−3 are used as an optimization to complete some of the recursive calls.

A practical method of computing functions similar to Ackermann's is to use [[memoization]]<!--NOT memorization--> of intermediate results. A compiler could apply this technique to a function automatically using [[Donald Michie]]'s "[[memo function]]s".<ref>[http://www.gtoal.com/plsql/ackerman-memo.pls.html Example: Explicit memo function version of Ackermann's function] implemented in PL/SQL</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Ackermann numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Googolplex]] -->
In ''The Book of Numbers'', [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]] define the sequence of '''Ackermann numbers''' to be 1↑1, 2↑↑2, 3↑↑↑3, etc.;<ref>John Horton Conway and Richard K. Guy. [http://books.google.com/books?id=0--3rcO7dMYC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=%22Ackermann%20number%22&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ackermann%20number%22&amp;f=false ''The Book of Numbers'']. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 60-61, 1996. ISBN 978-0-387-97993-9</ref> that is, the n<sup>th</sup> Ackermann number is defined to be n↑<sup>n</sup>n (''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...), where m↑<sup>k</sup>n is [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|Knuth's up-arrow]] version of the Ackermann function.

The first few Ackermann numbers are:
:* 1↑1 = 1<sup>1</sup> = 1,
:* 2↑↑2 = 2↑2 = 2<sup>2</sup> = 4,
:* 3↑↑↑3 = 3↑↑3↑↑3 = 3↑↑(3↑3↑3) = <math>3\uparrow\uparrow3^{3^3} = 3\uparrow\uparrow7625597484987 = \underbrace{3^{3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.^{3}}}}}}}}_{7625597484987{\rm\ threes}}</math>

The fourth Ackermann number, 4↑↑↑↑4, can be written in terms of [[tetration]] towers as follows:

:4↑↑↑↑4 = 4↑↑↑4↑↑↑4↑↑↑4 = 4↑↑↑4↑↑↑(4↑↑4↑↑4↑↑4)
:::<math> = \underbrace{~~^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}4}4}4~~}_{\underbrace{~^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4~}_{^{^{^{^4}4}4}4 {\rm\ fours}} {\rm fours}}</math>

Explanation: in the middle layer, there is a tower of tetration whose full height is <math>^{^{^{^4}4}4}4</math> and the final result is the top layer of tetrated 4's whose full height equals the calculation of the middle layer. Note that by way of size comparison, the simple expression <sup>4</sup>4 already exceeds a [[googolplex]], so the fourth Ackermann number is quite large.

Alternatively, this can be written in terms of [[exponentiation]] towers as
:<math>4\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = </math>
:<math>\quad</math>
:<math>
\left.
\begin{matrix} 4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\dots
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
4,
</math>
:where the number of towers on the previous line (including the rightmost "4") is
:<math>
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\dots
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
4,
</math>
:where the number of towers on the previous line (including the rightmost "4") is
:<math>
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
4,
</math>
where the number of "4"s in each tower, on each of the lines above, is specified by the value of the next tower to its right (as indicated by a brace).

<title>Acklam Grange Secondary School</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}}
'''Acklam Grange School''' is a [[Specialist school|specialist college]] of mathematics and computing, situated at the end of Lodore Grove, [[Acklam, Middlesbrough|Acklam]], [[Middlesbrough]].  It opened in 1952 and has gone through many changes, being first Hugh Bell School, then [[Acklam, Middlesbrough#Stainsby|Stainsby]] School, and currently Acklam Grange [[High school|Secondary School]].

The current Headteacher is John Bate, and together with his leadership team he has been responsible for much revolutionizing of the school and its' policies. 

The school is one of the few in the area that have continue to be a part of [[Building Schools for the Future]] after announced spending cuts by the Government.

== Facilities ==
On the site of the School is the [http://www.mclc.org.uk/ Middlesbrough City Learning Centre], providing specialist [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] facilities for the school and others in the area.  The centre is located on the Lodore side of school; there is also the Acorn Centre, a local sports centre, situated at the Heythrop entrance. 

== New Build ==

As of 6th September 2010, the school is open to pupils. Prior to this, pupils had involvement in areas ranging from landscaping to the naming of select areas. This has helped to make the school right for the pupils, as befits a Building Schools for the Future school.

The old school (consisting of the former Oaklands and Stainsby school) is due to be demolished from August 2010 to December 2010. It will be replaced by a carpark and landscaping to lead up to the school from the Lodore Grove entrance.

== [http://www.acklamgrange.org.uk/acorn/index.htm Acorn Centre] ==

The Acorn Centre is a £2.2 million sport and inclusion{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} facility which was opened in late January 2005 following its official launch by Gary Pallister (former Middlesbrough and England International footballer) and Councillor Hazel Pearson OBE. Situated on the site of Acklam Grange School, a specialist college of Mathematics and Computing in West Middlesbrough. The development has been made possible due to receiving significant investment from Acklam Grange School, Middlesbrough Council, The West Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Trust (WMNT) and The Big Lottery Fund.

The Acorn Centre is a Dual Use facility for local school and community networks.

The new building is currently being constructed on the playing fields opposite the school by contractors Wilmott Dixon. The build is expected to open in September 2010 and has cost over £27 million.

<title>Acknowledgment (creative arts)</title>
<text>
In the [[Creative Arts|creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgment''' (also spelled '''acknowledgement''') is an expression of gratitude for assistance in creating a literary or artistic work. 

Receiving [[credit (creative arts)|credit]] by way of acknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s).  Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgments; Giles &amp; Councill (2004) give the following six categories:
# [[moral support]]
# [[funding|financial support]]
# [[editing|editorial support]]
# [[presentation|presentational support]]
# [[technical support|instrumental/technical support]]
# [[conceptual support]], or [[peer interactive communication]] (PIC)
Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgment, acknowledgment of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt.  Some acknowledgments of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution.

'''ActivMedia Robotics''', former name of '''MobileRobots Inc''', is a company in [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]], [[New Hampshire]] that designs and manufactures [[autonomous robot]]s, commercial [[service robot]]s, [[robot software]] and navigation systems for robot developers and manufacturers.<ref>http://www.robots-dreams.com/2006/03/the_story_behin.html</ref>

Founded in 1995, it was an early developer of [[autonomous robots]] ubiquitous to universities and often the first serious robot used by students involved in learning to be roboticists, as evidenced by the fact that it was chosen by Microsoft as the reference platform on which to implement their new Robotics SDK and is supported by [[ROS]] and Player Stage Robot APIs.

Following in the footsteps of Cybermotion and MDARS-I, the company developed [[security robots]], but with more powerful computers and new autonomous techniques such as SLAM, Monte Carlo/Markov localization and modified value-iterated search path planning to create a new generation of [[autonomous robots]] for delivery and security purposes in hospitals, offices, labs and other buildings.<ref>* [http://search2.foxnews.com/search?access=p&amp;getfields=*&amp;sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;client=my_frontend&amp;filter=0&amp;site=video&amp;proxystylesheet=my_frontend&amp;q= Company Leads the Way in Robot Innovation, 2007-12-12 FOX News video]</ref> 

MobileRobots has also been a pioneer in flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by [http://www.rmtrobotics.com RMT Robotics] to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick-n-place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and [[industrial robot]] arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts. Smaller versions also work in semi-conductor plant clean rooms, carrying product from workstation to workstation.

In 2007, the company released a unique omni-directional Seekur security rover. The omni-directional wheels let it drive sideways as well as forwards and back, to perform in tight spaces. In early 2008, Seekur demonstrated autonomous navigation in GPS-blocked spaces around buildings.

In 2009, the company expanded the capabilities of its Motivity robot autonomy to enable fleets to behave more like people, following site-specific traffic rules and varying its speech and other aspects of its "personality" in ways appropriate to its workplace.

On June 14, 2010 MobileRobots Inc. was acquired by [[Adept Technology]]<ref name="adeptacqmobrob">{{cite web| title = Adept Technology Announces Acquisition Of Leading Autonomous Mobile Robot Provider| url =http://go.adept.com/content/adeptacqmobrob06142010 | accessdate    = 2008-07-09}}</ref>. Since then the company has been testing [http://ir.adept.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=522983 mobile conveyor robots] and [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/science/05robots.html?pagewanted=all telepresence systems] for use in corporate and hospital settings.

ActiveVideo Networks is the product of a 2006 merger between [[ICTV (TV)|ICTV]], a pioneer in interactive television content and platforms, and Switched Media, a developer of solutions for the [[customization]] of [[Video streaming|video streams]] within the compressed domain <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=52440 |title=ICTV acquires Switched Media |publisher=CED |date=February 7, 2006}}</ref>. The company was rechristened as ActiveVideo Networks in 2008 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://newteevee.com/2008/05/17/ictv-is-now-activevideo-networks/ |title=ICTV Is Now ActiveVideo Networks |publisher=NewTeeVee |date=May 17, 2008}}</ref>. In 2009, the company established a presence in Europe with the acquisition of Avinity Systems, B.V.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/277515-ActiveVideo_Snaps_Up_Dutch_ITV_Firm.php?q=Avinity |title=ActiveVideo Snaps Up Dutch iTV Firm |publisher=Multichannel News |date=June 1, 2009}}</ref>.

At the end of 2009, the CloudTV system was in approximately five million homes through cable and [[IPTV]] providers such as [[Cablevision]] Systems Corporation, Oceanic Time Warner Cable and [[PCCW]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/blog.asp?blog_sectionid=419&amp;doc_id=183923&amp;site=cdn |title=ActiveVideo's Year of Reckoning |publisher=Cable Digital News |date= October 30, 2009}}</ref>; the company expects CloudTV to be in 10 million homes by the end of 2010 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://itvt.com/story/6412/activevideo-signs-trailer-park-first-major-content-developer-its-cloudtv-platform |title=ActiveVideo Signs Up Trailer Park as First Major Content Developer for its CloudTV Platform |publisher=InteractiveTV Today—itvt |date=January 25, 2010}}</ref>.

== Expanding partnership with Cablevision ==
In February 2010, ActiveVideo's technology was used to power a Cablevision digital cable interactive channel dedicated to the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. The channel provided a mosaic of small video images that offered one-click, instant access to coverage on NBCU's various networks, along with supplemental Olympics content <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/448950-Cablevision_Provides_Interactive_Multiplatform_Olympic_Coverage.php |title=Cablevision Provides Interactive, Multiplatform Olympic Coverage |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=February 11, 2010}}</ref>. The channel was available to all Cablevision customers with a digital set-top box <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/News-ActiveVideo-Cablevision-Olympics-coverage-021210.aspx?wnnvz=1749,01295804030 |title=ActiveVideo enhances Cablevision’s Olympics coverage |publisher=CED Magazine |date=February 12, 2010}}</ref>. ActiveVideo powered a similar interactive mosaic channel for Time Warner Cable’s Oceanic system in Hawaii <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=187931&amp;site=lr_cable |title=Winter Games Go Interactive… for Some TV Viewers |publisher=Light Reading |date=February 12, 2010}}</ref>. ActiveVideo revealed that the mosaic application and the platform through which all of the content was made available was the same ActiveVideo technology employed by Time Warner Cable's Oceanic system during the 2008 Summer Olympics, and that several other unidentified cable operators were using the ActiveVideo platform to provide similar 2010 Vancouver Olympics coverage <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/News-ActiveVideo-Cablevision-Olympics-coverage-021210.aspx?wnnvz=1749,01295804030 |title=ActiveVideo enhances Cablevision’s Olympics coverage |publisher=CED Magazine |date=February 12, 2010}}</ref>.

Two published cable trade magazine reports in February 2010 speculated, but did not confirm, that ActiveVideo technology was being used to power a new Cablevision service to be tested in June 2010 called PC to TV Media Relay, which the cable operator said will deliver media sourced from a cable subscriber's PC (such as iTunes content, digital photos, and Web video) to digital set-top boxes, and from there onto the subscriber's TV screen <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/449355-Cablevision_Launches_Web_to_TV_Product.php?rssid=20065 |title=Cablevision Launches Web-to-TV Product |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=February 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=188331&amp;site=lr_cable&amp; |title=Cablevision to Deliver Net Content to Set-Tops |publisher=Light Reading |date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>. Cablevision confirmed in May 2010 that it has used ActiveVideo’s CloudTV platform to launch over two dozen new interactive channel experiences for its digital cable subscribers, including hyper-local sports, news and children’s channels, advertising showcases and mosaic programming, and that additional channels including more personalized content and hyper-targeted advertising are in development. Examples include MSG Varsity Interactive, News12 Interactive, and several navigational mosaic channels called iO Quick Views <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/452415-ActiveVideo_Powers_Cablevision_Interactive_Apps.php |title=ActiveVideo Powers Cablevision Interactive Apps |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=May 10, 2010}}</ref>.

== Consumer electronics strategy ==
In December 2009, ActiveVideo announced that it was extending availability of the CloudTV platform to consumer electronics devices such as HDTVs, Blu-ray players, media servers, game consoles and mobile devices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twice.com/article/441083-ActiveVideo_Advances_CloudTV_CE_Strategy.php?rssid=20328&amp;q=activevideo |title=ActiveVideo Advances CloudTV Strategy |publisher=TWICE |date=December 18, 2009}}</ref>.

== Partnership with Blockbuster ==
In January 2010, [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] announced that it will use CloudTV to provide a Web-based interface for its Blockbuster On Demand movie service across multiple connected platforms <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=948306 |title=Blockbuster Inks Deal with ActiveVideo |publisher=Broadcast Newsroom |date=January 6, 2010}}</ref>.

== Partnership with Trailer Park ==
In January 2010, ActiveVideo signed a deal with entertainment [[marketing]] agency [[Trailer Park, Inc.|Trailer Park]], under which Trailer Park's Advanced Content group became the first major content developer to officially embrace CloudTV <ref>{{cite web |url=http://itvt.com/story/6412/activevideo-signs-trailer-park-first-major-content-developer-its-cloudtv-platform |title=ActiveVideo Signs Up Trailer Park as First Major Content Developer for its CloudTV Platform |publisher=InteractiveTV Today—itvt |date=January 25, 2010}}</ref>.

== Developments at ANGA Cable Show 2010 ==
At the ANGA Cable Show in May 2010, ActiveVideo demonstrated its iPhone Remote Control App, which enables gesture-based interactivity; improved keyboarding, navigation, and search and discovery; and the ability to upload photos on a cable subscriber's TV. The company claimed this “touch-navigated” app can be used in combination with any smartphone or web device, and can bring two-way functionality to existing one-way cable operator networks <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/04/28/activevideo-showcases-iphone-controlled-interactive-tv/ |title=ActiveVideo shows iPhone-controlled interactive TV |publisher=Broadband TV News |date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>. ActiveVideo also announced at ANGA an integraton partnership with SMiT, a provider of conditional access modules to European cable operators like Kabel Deutschland and Ziggo, in which ActiveVideo’s CloudTV platform works with SMiT’s CI Plus modules. ActiveVideo demonstrated how Cloud TV can enable operator-branded menus on CI Plus-enabled TVs, including TVs without set-top boxes when combined with the Ethernet or WiFi connectivity of the host TV as a return channel. The integration also supported ActiveVideo’s iPhone Remote Control App <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cable360.net/ct/news/thewire/SMiT-and-ActiveVideo-Partner-for-Demo-at-ANGA_41185.html |title=SMiT and ActiveVideo Partner for Demo at ANGA |publisher=Communications Technology |date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>.

== Acquisition of TAG Networks ==
ActiveVideo expanded its relationship with games-on-demand provider TAG Networks in January 2010, with the goal of bringing TAG content to broadband-connected consumer electronics devices <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandgear.net/archives/bgr/2010/012110/products.cfm#6 |title=ActiveVideo Expands Relationship with TAG Networks |publisher=Broadband Gear Report |date=January 21, 2010}}</ref>. In May 2010, ActiveVideo formalized the relationship by acquiring TAG Networks <ref>{{cite web |url=http://newteevee.com/2010/05/05/activevideo-adds-gaming-with-tag-networks-acquisition/ |title=ActiveVideo Adds Gaming With TAG Networks Acquisition |publisher=NewTeeVee |date=May 5, 2010}}</ref>. With this transaction, ActiveVideo expressed its intention to expand the availability of on-demand games through cable set-top boxes by adding TAG’s casual gaming capabilities to its CloudTV platform, and enabling developers to create games that can be accessed directly through set-top boxes, Internet-connected TVs and other IP-capable consumer electronics devices. Although terms of the deal were not disclosed, it was announced that the TAG Networks management team and staff would join ActiveVideo, and that the TAG offices would move from Mountain View, Calif., to ActiveVideo's headquarters in San Jose <ref>{{cite web |url=http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2010/05/03/daily60.html |title=ActiveVideo acquires TAG Networks |publisher=San Jose Business Journal |date=May 5, 2010}}</ref>.

== NCTA Cable Show 2010: iVOD ==
At the NCTA Cable Show in May 2010, ActiveVideo demonstrated how its CloudTV platform can enable [[iVOD]] applications that would allow cable operators to enhance their video-on-demand (VOD) services. Such proposed services would provide subscribers with unified content across multiple platforms, a higher degree of personalization, improved recommendations to other content, and social networking functions. ActiveVideo’s demonstration proposes to bring linear television, VOD, interactive TV, Web video, casual games, advertising and user-generated content into one interface <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itvt.com/story/6754/activevideo-networks-outline-ivod-concept-ncta-cable-show |title=ActiveVideo Networks to Outline "iVOD" Concept at NCTA Cable Show |publisher=ITVT |date=May 11, 2010}}</ref>.

ActiveVideo also announced a joint initiative with advanced advertising technology provider This Technology at The Cable Show that the companies said would enable cable operators and programmers to derive increased monetization and control over iVOD advertising. Under the initiative, ActiveVideo's CloudTV platform and This Technology's Metamore and Spotbuilder software will be paired to create an SCTE-130-compliant ad serving and delivery solution for operators and programmers that dynamically targets traditional, Web-based and interactive advertising in conjunction with viewers' VOD activity <ref>{{cite web |url=http://itvt.com/story/6764/activevideo-networks-technology-team-dynamic-advertising-solution-ivod |title=ActiveVideo Networks, This Technology Team on Dynamic Advertising Solution for "iVOD" |publisher=ITVT |date=May 12, 2010}}</ref>.

<title>Active database</title>
<text>{{orphan|date=November 2009}}

An '''Active Database''' is a [[database]] that includes an event driven architecture (often in the form of [[Event Condition Action|ECA rules]]) which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database.  Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization.

Most modern relational databases include active database features in the form of [[Database trigger|SQL Triggers]].

<title>Activity diagram</title>
<text>[[Image:Activity conducting.svg|thumb|upright=2|UML 1.x Activity diagram for a guided [[brainstorming]] [[process]]]]

'''Activity diagrams''' are graphical representations of [[workflow]]s of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency.<ref>[http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0077110005/student_view0/glossary.html Glossary of Key Terms] at McGraw-hill.com. Retrieved 20 July 2008.</ref> In the [[Unified Modeling Language]], activity diagrams can be used to describe the business and operational step-by-step [[workflow]]s of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.

== Construction ==
Activity diagrams are constructed from a limited repertoire of shapes, connected with arrows.  The most important shape types:
* ''rounded rectangles'' represent ''activities'';
* ''diamonds'' represent ''decisions'';
* ''bars'' represent the start (''split'') or end (''join'') of concurrent activities;
* a ''black circle'' represents the start (''initial state'') of the workflow;
* an ''encircled black circle'' represents the end (''final state'').
Arrows run from the start towards the end and represent the order in which activities happen.

Hence they can be regarded as a form of [[flowchart]].  Typical flowchart techniques lack constructs for expressing concurrency.  However, the join and split symbols in activity diagrams only resolve this for simple cases; the meaning of the model is not clear when they are arbitrarily combined with decisions or loops.

While in UML 1.x, activity diagrams were a specialized form of state diagrams, in UML 2.x, the activity diagrams were reformalized to be based on [[Petri net]]-like semantics, increasing the scope of situations that can be modeled using activity diagrams. These changes cause many UML 1.x activity diagrams to be interpreted differently in UML 2.x

== '''Applications''' ==
In [[Systems Modeling Language|SysML]] the activity diagram has been extended to indicate flows among steps that convey physical matter (e.g., gasoline) or energy (e.g., torque, pressure). Additional changes allow the diagram to better support continuous behaviors and continuous data flows.

== Alternatives ==
In UML 1.x, an alternative to activity diagrams is the [[State_diagram#UML state diagram|UML State diagram]], in which states can be used to represent activities (namely the state of that activity being performed), and transitions represent the start or completion of activities.

This mapping of activity diagram features to state diagram were formalized in UML 1.x, leaving activity diagrams little more that the use of state machines to capture behavior and partially concurrent behavior within a work flow.

Despite the (small) advantages of using UML 1.x activity diagram over state machines, such as the ability to cover the behaviors of collaborating elements, while state machines are limited to a single element, many modelers continued using state diagrams. State machines were attractive to use as the states may also represent conditions that hold before or after the activities. Activity diagrams and state diagram had similar abilities to express concurrency, though the run-to-completion (RTC) semantics of State machines limited the expressiveness of the concurrency.  

Perhaps the most important reason why state machines were more popular in UML 1.x over activity diagrams was that the tool vendors were slow to implement robust activity diagram capabilities.     

With UML 2.x, the foundation of activity diagram changed from being based on state-machine semantics to now being based on [[Petri net]] semantics. This vastly expand the number of circumstances where activity diagrams are more appropriate to capture the paths of work flow in a system. Now with the advent of robust activity diagram implementations, activity diagrams are now generally used more than state machine diagrams.

<title>Activity recognition</title>
<text>'''Activity recognition''' aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. Since the 1980s, this research field has captured the attention of several [[computer science]] communities due to its strength in providing personalized support for many different applications and its connection to many different fields of study such as medicine, human-computer interaction, or sociology.

To understand activity recognition better, consider the following scenario. An elderly man wakes up at dawn in his small studio apartment, where he stays alone. He lights the stove to make a pot of tea, switches on the toaster oven, and takes some bread and jelly from the cupboard. After taking his morning medication, a computer-generated voice gently reminds him to turn off the toaster. Later that day, his daughter accesses a secure website where she scans a check-list, which was created by a sensor network in her father's apartment. She finds that her father is eating normally, taking his medicine on schedule, and continuing to manage his daily life on his own. That information puts her mind at ease.

Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity recognition; examples include assisting the sick and disabled. For example, Pollack et al.<ref>Pollack, M.E., and et al., L. E. B. 2003. "Autominder: an intelligent cognitive orthotic system for people with memory impairment". ''Robotics and Autonomous Systems'' 44(3-4):273–282.</ref> show that by automatically monitoring human activities, home-based rehabilitation can be provided for people suffering from traumatic brain injuries. One can find applications ranging from security-related applications and logistics support to location-based services. Due to its many-faceted nature, different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition, goal recognition, intent recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and location-based services.

==Types of activity recognition==
===Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition===
[[Sensor]]-based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]] techniques to model a wide range of human activities.<ref>Tanzeem Choudhury, Gaetano Borriello, et al. The Mobile Sensing Platform: An Embedded System for Activity Recognition. Appears in the IEEE Pervasive Magazine - Special Issue on Activity-Based Computing, April 2008.</ref> Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous computers]] and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf.

====Levels of sensor-based activity recognition====
Sensor-based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, [[statistical modeling]] has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, [[statistical inference]] may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning. Scientific conferences where activity recognition work from wearable and environmental often appears are [[ISWC]] and [[UbiComp]].

===Sensor-based, multi-user activity recognition===
Recognizing activities for multiple users using on-body sensors first appeared in the work by ORL using active badge systems <ref>Want R., Hopper A., Falcao V., Gibbons J.: The Active Badge Location System, ACM Transactions on Information, Systems, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 91-102, January 1992</ref> in the early 90´s. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios.<ref>Bieber G., Kirste T., Untersuchung des gruppendynamischen Aktivitaetsverhaltes im Office-Umfeld, 7. Berliner Werkstatt Mensch-Maschine-Systeme, Berlin, Germany, 2007</ref> Activities of Multiple Users in intelligent environments are addressed in Gu et al.<ref>Tao Gu, Zhanqing Wu, Liang Wang, Xianping Tao, and Jian Lu. Mining Emerging Patterns for Recognizing Activities of Multiple Users in Pervasive Computing. In Proc. of the 6th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (MobiQuitous '09), Toronto, Canada, July 13–16, 2009.</ref> In this work, they investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities for multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment, and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single-user and multi-user activities in a unified solution. Many interesting research topics can be spawn from this work.

===Vision-based activity recognition===
It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras. The primary technique employed is computer vision. Vision-based activity recognition has found many applications such as human-computer interaction, user interface design, robot learning, and surveillance, among others.
Scientific conferences where vision based activity recognition work often appears are [[ICCV]] and [[CVPR]].

In vision-based activity recognition, a great deal of work has been done. Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as [[optical flow]], [[Kalman filtering]], hidden [[Markov model]]s, etc., under different modalities such as single camera, stereo, and infrared. In addition, researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic, including single pedestrian tracking, group tracking, and detecting dropped objects.

====Levels of vision-based activity recognition====
In vision-based activity recognition, the computational process is often divided into four steps, namely human detection, human tracking, human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation.

==Approaches of activity recognition==
===Activity recognition through logic and reasoning===
Logic-based approaches keep track of all [[logically consistent]] explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz<ref>H. Kautz. "A formal theory of plan recognition". In PhD thesis, University of Rochester, 1987.</ref> provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription. All actions, plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented by a set of first-order statements called event hierarchy encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events.

Kautz's general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case, measured in the size of input hierarchy. Lesh and Etzioni<ref>N. Lesh and O. Etzioni. "A sound and fast goal recognizer". In ''Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence'', 1995.</ref> went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally. In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries.

Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive. Besides, they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual's recent behavior. Pollack et al. described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description.

A serious problem of logic-based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty. They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another, as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed. There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods.

===Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning===
Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals.

Plan recognition can be done as a process of reasoning under uncertainty, which is convincingly argued by Charniak and Goldman.<ref>E. Charniak and R.P. Goldman. "A Bayesian model of plan recognition". ''Artificial Intelligence'', 64:53–79, 1993.</ref> They argued that any model that does not incorporate some theory of uncertainty reasoning cannot be adequate. In the literature, there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent's plans and goals.

Using sensor data as input, Hodges and Pollack designed machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily activities such as making coffee.<ref>M.R. Hodges and M.E. Pollack. "An 'object-use fingerprint': The use of electronic sensors for human identification". In ''Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing'', 2007.</ref> Intel Research (Seattle) Lab and University of Washington at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans.<ref>Mike Perkowitz, Matthai Philipose, Donald J. Patterson, and Kenneth P. Fishkin. "Mining models of human activities from the web". In ''Proceedings of the Thirteenth International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2004), pages 573–582, May 2004.</ref><ref>Matthai Philipose, Kenneth P. Fishkin, Mike Perkowitz, Donald J. Patterson, Dieter Fox, Henry Kautz, and Dirk Hähnel. "Inferring activities from interactions with objects". In ''IEEE Pervasive Computing'', pages 50–57, October 2004.</ref><ref>Dieter Fox Lin Liao, Donald J. Patterson and Henry A. Kautz. "Learning and inferring transportation routines". ''Artif. Intell.'', 171(5-6):311–331, 2007.</ref> Some of these works infer user transportation modes from readings of radio-frequency identifiers (RFID) and global positioning systems (GPS).

===Wi-Fi-based activity recognition===
When activity recognition is performed indoors and in cities using the widely available [[Wi-Fi]] signals and [[802.11]] access points, there is much noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties are modeled using a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] model by Yin et al.<ref>Jie Yin, Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "High-level Goal Recognition in a Wireless LAN". In ''Proceedings of the Nineteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI-04), San Jose, CA USA, July 2004. Pages 578-584</ref> A multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals is presented by Chai and Yang,<ref>Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "Multiple-Goal Recognition From Low-level Signals". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburg, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 3-8.</ref> where a [[deterministic]] state transition model is applied. A better model that models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach is proposed by Hu and Yang.<ref>Derek Hao Hu, Qiang Yang. "CIGAR: Concurrent and Interleaving Goal and Activity Recognition", to appear in AAAI 2008</ref> A user action discovery model is presented by Yin et al.,<ref>Jie Yin, Dou Shen, Qiang Yang and Ze-nian Li "Activity Recognition through Goal-Based Segmentation". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburg, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 28-33.</ref> where the Wi-Fi signals are segmented to produce possible actions.

A fundamental problem in Wi-Fi-based activity recognition is to estimate the user locations. Two important issues are how to reduce the human labelling effort and how to cope with the changing signal profiles when the environment changes. Yin et al.<ref>Jie Yin, Qiang Yang and Lionel Ni. "Adaptive Temporal Radio Maps for Indoor Location Estimation". In ''Proceedings of the 3rd Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications'' (IEEE PerCom 2005), Kauai Island, Hawaii, March, 2005. Pages 85-94.</ref> dealt with the second issue by transferring the labelled knowledge between time periods. Chai and Yang<ref>Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang. "Reducing the Calibration Effort for Location Estimation Using Unlabeled Samples". In ''Proceedings of the 3rd Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications'', (IEEE PerCom 2005) Kauai Island, Hawaii, March 2005. Pages 95--104.</ref> proposed a hidden Markov model-based method to extend labelled knowledge by leveraging the unlabelled user traces. J. Pan et al.<ref>Jeffrey Junfeng Pan, Qiang Yang and Sinno Jialin Pan. "Online Co-Localization in Indoor Wireless Networks". In ''Proceedings of the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI'07) Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. July 2007. 1102-1107</ref> propose to perform location estimation through online co-localization, and S. Pan et al.<ref>Sinno Jialin Pan, James T. Kwok, Qiang Yang, Jeffrey Junfeng Pan. "Adaptive localization in a dynamic WiFi environment through multi-view learning". In ''Proceedings of the 22nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI'07) Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. July 2007. 1108-1113</ref> proposed to apply multi-view learning for migrating the labelled data to a new time period.

===Data mining based approach to activity recognition===
Different from traditional machine learning approaches, a novel approach based on data mining has been recently proposed by a research group led by Dr. Gu.<ref>Tao Gu, Zhanqing Wu, Xianping Tao, Hung Keng Pung, and Jian Lu. epSICAR: An Emerging Patterns based Approach to Sequential, Interleaved and Concurrent Activity Recognition. In Proc. of the 7th Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (Percom '09), Galveston, Texas, March 9–13, 2009.</ref> In this approach, the problem of activity recognition is formulated as a pattern-based classification problem. They proposed a novel data mining approach based on discriminative patterns which describe significant changes between any two activity classes of data to recognize sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities in a unified solution. The advantages of such an approach are: Firstly, they provide a solution which recognizes sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities in a unified computation framework. Secondly, no training is required for interleaved and concurrent activities since these two activity models can be derived directly from the sequential activity model. Thirdly, their solution is more noise tolerant because mining the differences of classes will not include noise patterns provided the noise distribution is random among classes. The noise-tolerant feature is particularly important in sensor-based activity recognition.

<title>Actor model and process calculi</title>
<text>{{Copy to Wikibooks}}

In [[computer science]], the '''[[Actor model]]''' and [[Process calculi|'''process calculi''']] are two closely related approaches to the modelling of [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrent digital computation]].  See [[Actor model and process calculi history]].

There are many similarities between the two approaches, but also several differences (some philosophical, some technical):
*There is only one [[Actor model]] (although it has numerous formal systems for design, analysis, verification, modeling, ''etc.''); there are numerous [[process calculi]], developed for reasoning about a variety of different kinds of concurrent systems at various levels of detail (including calculi that incorporate time, stochastic transitions, or constructs specific to application areas such as security analysis).
*The Actor model was inspired by the laws of [[physics]] and depends on them for its fundamental axioms, ''i.e.'' [[physical law]]s (see [[Actor model theory]]); the process calculi were originally inspired by [[algebra]] {{harv|Milner|1993}}. 
*Processes in the process calculi are anonymous, and communicate by sending messages either through named [[Channel (communications)|channels]] (synchronous or asynchronous), or via [[Ambient calculus|ambients]] (which can also be used to model channel-like communications {{harv|Cardelli and Gordon|1998}}). In contrast, actors in the Actor model possess an identity, and communicate by sending messages to the mailing addresses of other actors (this style of communication can also be used to model channel-like communications &amp;mdash; see below).    

The publications on the Actor model and on process calculi have a fair number of cross-references, acknowledgments, and reciprocal citations (see [[Actor model and process calculi history]]).

==How do channels work?==
Indirect communication using channels (''e.g.'' Gilles Kahn and David MacQueen [1977]) has been an important issue for communication in parallel and concurrent computation affecting both semantics and performance.  Some process calculi differ from the Actor model in their use of channels as opposed to direct communication.

==Issues with synchronous channels==
Synchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel must wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel before the sender can proceed.

===Simple synchronous channels===

A synchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> communications.  The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple synchronous channel:
*Each <tt>put</tt> communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent when the message is received by a <tt>get</tt> communication from the channel in [[FIFO]] order.
*Each <tt>get</tt>  communication has an address to which the received message is sent.

===Synchronous channels in process calculi===

However, simple synchronous channels do not suffice for process calculi such as [[Communicating Sequential Processes]] (CSP) [Hoare 1978 and 1985] because use of the ''guarded choice'' (after Dijkstra) command (called the ''alternative'' command in CSP).  In a guarded choice command multiple offers (called guards) can be made concurrently on multiple channels to <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> messages; however at most one of the guards can be chosen for each execution of the guarded choice command.  Because only one guard can be chosen, a guarded choice command in general effectively requires a kind of [[two-phase commit protocol]] or perhaps even a [[three-phase commit protocol]] if [[Timeout (telecommunication)|time-outs]] are allowed in guards (as in Occam 3 [1992]).

Consider the following program written in CSP [Hoare 1978]:
 [X :: Z!stop() ||
  Y :: guard: boolean; guard := true;
      *[guard  →  Z!go(); Z?guard] ||
  Z :: n: integer; n:= 0;
        *[X?stop()  →  Y!false; print!n;
          [] Y?go()  →  n := n+1; Y!true]
 ]
According to Clinger [1981], this program illustrates global nondeterminism, since the nondeterminism arises from incomplete specification of the timing of signals between the three processes <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt>.  The repetitive guarded command in the definition of <tt>Z</tt> has two alternatives:  
#the <tt>stop</tt> message is accepted from <tt>X</tt>, in which case <tt>Y</tt> is sent the value '''false''' and <tt>print</tt> is sent the value <tt>n</tt>
#a <tt>go</tt> message is accepted from <tt>Y</tt>, in which case <tt>n</tt> is incremented and <tt>Y</tt> is sent the value '''true'''.
If <tt>Z</tt> ever accepts the <tt>stop</tt> message from <tt>X</tt>, then <tt>X</tt> terminates.  Accepting the <tt>stop</tt> causes <tt>Y</tt> to be sent '''false''' which when input as the value of its guard will cause <tt>Y</tt> to terminate.  When both <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> have terminated, <tt>Z</tt> terminates because it no longer has live processes providing input.

In the above program, there are synchronous channels from <tt>X</tt> to <tt>Z</tt>, <tt>Y</tt> to <tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt> to <tt>Y</tt>.

===Analogy with the committee coordination problem===
According to Knabe [1992], Chandy and Misra [1988] characterized this as analogous to the committee coordination problem:

:Professors in a university are assigned to various committees.  Occasionally a professor will decide to attend a meeting of any of her committees, and will wait until that is possible.  Meetings may begin only if there is full attendance.  The task is to ensure that if all the members of a committee are waiting, then at least one of them will attend some meeting.
:The crux of this problem is that two or more committees might share a professor.  When that professor becomes available, she can only choose one of the meetings, while the others continue to wait.

===A simple distributed protocol===
This section presents a simple distributed protocol for channels in synchronous process calculi.  The protocol has some problems that are addressed in the sections below.

The behavior of a guarded choice command is as follows:
*The command sends a message to each of its guards to <tt>prepare</tt>.
*When it receives the first response from one of its guards that it is prepared, then it sends a message to that guard to <tt>prepare to commit</tt> and sends messages to all of the other guards to <tt>abort</tt>.
**When it receives a message from the guard that it is <tt>prepared to commit</tt>, then it sends the guard a <tt>commit</tt> message. However, if the guard throws an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit</tt>, then guarded choice command starts the whole process all over again.
*If all of its guards respond that they cannot <tt>prepare</tt>, then the guarded command does nothing.

The behavior of a guard is as follows:
*When a message to <tt>prepare</tt> is received, then the guard sends a <tt>prepare</tt> message to each of the channels with which it is offering to communicate.  If the guard has booleans such that it cannot <tt>prepare<tt> or if any of the channels respond that they cannot <tt>prepare</tt>, then it sends <tt>abort</tt> messages to the other channels and then responds that it cannot <tt>prepare</tt>.
:*When a message to <tt>prepare to commit</tt> is received, then the guard sends a <tt>prepare to commit</tt> message to each of the channels. If any of the channels respond that they cannot <tt>prepare to commit</tt>, then it sends <tt>abort</tt> messages to the other channels and then throws an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit</tt>.
:*When a message to <tt>commit</tt> is received, then the guard sends an <tt>commit</tt> message to each of the channels.
:*When a message to <tt>abort</tt> is received, then the guard sends an <tt>abort</tt> message to each of the channels.

The behavior of a channel is as follows:
*When a <tt>prepare to put</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to get</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to put</tt>.
*When a <tt>prepare to get</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to put<tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to get</tt>.
:*When a <tt>prepare to commit to put</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to commit to get</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit to put</tt>.
:*When a <tt>prepare to commit to get</tt> communication is received, then respond that it is prepared if there is a <tt>prepare to commit to put</tt> communication pending unless a <tt>terminate</tt> communication has been received, in which case throw an exception that it cannot <tt>prepare to commit to get</tt>.
::*When a <tt>commit put</tt> communication is received, then depending on which of the following is received:
::**When a <tt>commit get</tt> communication is received, then if not already done perform the <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> and clean up the preparations.
::**When an <tt>abort get</tt> communication is received, then cancel the preparations
::*When a <tt>commit get</tt> communication is received, then depending on which of the following is received:
::**When a <tt>commit put</tt> communication is received, then if not already done perform the <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt> and clean up the preparations.
::**When an <tt>abort put</tt> communication is received, then cancel the preparations.
::*When an <tt>abort put</tt> communication is received, then cancel the preparations.
::*When an <tt>abort get</tt> communication is received, then cancel the preparations.

===Starvation on getting from multiple channels===
Again consider the program written in CSP (discussed in [[Actor model and process calculi#Synchronous channels in process calculi|Synchronous channels in process calculi]] above):
 [X :: Z!stop() ||
  Y :: guard: boolean; guard := true;
      *[guard  →  Z!go(); Z?guard] ||
  Z :: n: integer; n:= 0;
        *[X?stop()  →  Y!false; print!n;
          [] Y?go()  →  n := n+1; Y!true]
 ]

As pointed out in Knabe [1992], a problem with the above protocol ([[Actor model and process calculi#A simple distributed protocol|A simple distributed protocol]]) is that the process <tt>Z</tt> might never accept the <tt>stop</tt> message from <tt>X</tt> (a phenomenon called [[Resource starvation|starvation]]) and consequently the above program might never print anything.

In contrast consider, a simple Actor system that consists of Actors '''X''', '''Y''', '''Z''', and '''print''' where

:the Actor '''X''' is created with the following behavior:
:*If the message <tt>"start"</tt> is received, then send '''Z''' the message  <tt>"stop"</tt>

:the Actor '''Y''' is created with the following behavior:
:*If the message <tt>"start"</tt> is received, then send '''Z''' the message  <tt>"go"</tt>
:*If the message '''true''' is received, then send '''Z''' the message  <tt>"go"</tt>
:*If the message '''false''' is received, then do nothing

:the Actor '''Z''' is created with the following behavior that has a count <tt>n</tt> that is initially '''0''':
:*If the message <tt>"start"</tt> is received, then do nothing.
:*If the message <tt>"stop"</tt> is received, then send '''Y''' the message '''false''' and send '''print''' the message the count <tt>n</tt>.
:*If the message <tt>"go"</tt> is received, then send '''Y''' the message '''true''' and process the next message received with count <tt>n</tt> being <tt>n+1</tt>.

By the laws of Actor semantics, the above Actor system will always halt when the Actors '''X''', '''Y''', are '''Z''' are each sent a <tt>"start"</tt> message resulting in sending '''print''' a number that can be unbounded large.

The difference between the CSP program and the Actor system is that the Actor '''Z''' does not get messages using a guarded choice command from multiple channels.  Instead it processes messages in arrival ordering, and by the laws for Actor systems, the <tt>stop</tt> message is guaranteed to arrive.

===Livelock on getting from multiple channels===
Consider the following program written in CSP  [Hoare 1978]:
 [Bidder1 :: b: bid;
        *[Bids1?b  →  process1!b;
          [] Bids2?b  →  process1!b;] ||
  Bidder2 :: b: bid;
        *[Bids1?b  →  process2!b;
          [] Bids2?b  →  process2!b;] 
 ]

As pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol ([[Actor model and process calculi#A simple distributed protocol|A simple distributed protocol]]) is that the process <tt>Bidder2</tt> might never accept a bid from <tt>Bid1</tt> or <tt>Bid2</tt> (a phenomenon called [[livelock]]) and consequently <tt>process2</tt> might never be sent anything.  In each attempt to accept a message, <tt>Bidder2</tt> is thwarted because the bid that was offered by <tt>Bids1</tt> or <tt>Bids2</tt> is snatched away by <tt>Bidder1</tt> because it turns out that <tt>Bidder1</tt> has much faster access than <tt>Bidder2</tt> to <tt>Bids1</tt> and <tt>Bids2</tt>.  Consequently <tt>Bidder1</tt> can accept a bid, process it and accept another bid before <tt>Bidder2</tt> can commit to accepting a bid.

===Efficiency===
As pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol ([[Actor model and process calculi#A simple distributed protocol|A simple distributed protocol]]) is the large number of communications that must be sent in order to perform the handshaking in order to send a message through a synchronous channel.  Indeed as shown in the previous section ([[Actor model and process calculi#Livelock on getting from multiple channels|Livelock]]), the number of communications can be unbounded.

===Summary of Issues===
The subsections above have articulated the following three issues concerned with the use of synchronous channels for process calculi:
#''Starvation.'' The use of sychronous channels can cause starvation when a process attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command.
#''Livelock.'' The use of synchronous channels can cause a process to be caught in livelock when it attempts to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command.
#''Efficiency.''  The use of synchronous channels can require a large number of communications in order to get messages from multiple channels in a guarded choice command.

It is notable that in all of the above, issues arise from the use of a guarded choice command to get messages from multiple channels.

Asynchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel need not wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel.

===Simple asynchronous channels===

An asynchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt> communications.  The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple asynchronous channel:
*Each <tt>put</tt> communication has a message and an address to which an acknowledgment is sent immediately (without waiting for the message to be gotten by a <tt>get</tt> communication).
*Each <tt>get</tt>  communication has an address to which the gotten message is sent.

===Asynchronous channels in process calculi===
The Join-calculus programming language (published in 1996) implemented local and distributed concurrent computations.  It incorporated asynchronous channels as well as a kind of synchronous channel that is used for procedure calls. Agha's Aπ Actor calculus {{harv|Agha and Thati|2004}} is based on a typed version of the asynchronous [[Pi-calculus|π-calculus]].

==Algebras==
The use of algebraic techniques was pioneered in the process calculi.  Subsequently several different process calculi intended to provide algebraic reasoning about Actor systems have been developed in {{harv|Gaspari and Zavattaro|1997}}, {{harv|Gaspari and Zavattaro|1999}}, {{harv|Agha and Thati|2004}}

==Denotational Semantics==
Will Clinger (building on the work of Irene Greif [1975], Gordon Plotkin [1976], [[Henry Baker (computer scientist)|Henry Baker]] [1978], Michael Smyth [1978], and Francez, [[Hoare]], Lehmann, and de Roever [1979]) published the first satisfactory mathematical [[Denotational semantics|denotational]] theory of the [[Actor model]] using [[domain theory]] in [[denotational semantics of the Actor model#Clinger's Model|his dissertation]] in 1981.  His semantics contrasted the [[unbounded nondeterminism]] of the [[Actor model]] with the bounded nondeterminism of [[Communicating Sequential Processes|CSP]] [Hoare 1978] and Concurrent Processes [Milne and Milner 1979] (see [[denotational semantics]]). Roscoe [2005] has developed a denotational semantics with unbounded nondeterminism for a subsequent version of Communicating Sequential Processes Hoare [1985].  More recently [[Carl Hewitt]] [2006b] developed a denotational semantics for Actors based on [[Denotational semantics of the Actor model#The Timed Diagrams Model|timed diagrams]]. 

Ugo Montanari and Carolyn Talcott [1998] have contributed to attempting to reconcile Actors with process calculi.

'''AdSense''' is an [[ad serving]] application run by [[Google Inc.]] Website owners can enroll in this program to enable text, image, and video [[advertisements]] on their websites. These advertisements are administered by Google and generate revenue on either a [[Cost Per Click|per-click]] or [[Cost Per Impression|per-impression]] basis. Google [[beta-testing|beta tested]] a [[Cost Per Action|cost-per-action]] service, but discontinued it in October 2008 in favor of a [[DoubleClick]] offering (also owned by Google).<ref>[http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=97264 What happened to the pay-per-action beta?]</ref> In Q1 2010, Google earned US$2.04 billion ($8.16 billion annualized), or 30% of total revenue, through AdSense.<ref>[http://investor.google.com/earnings/2010/Q1_google_earnings.html "Google Announces First Quarter 2010 Financial Results"]. Google. Retrieved June 18, 2010.</ref>

==Overview==
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2010}}

Google uses its [[Internet search]] technology to serve advertisements based on website content, the user's geographical location, and other factors. Those wanting to advertise with Google's targeted advertisement system may enroll through [[AdWords]]. AdSense has become a popular method of placing advertising on a website because the advertisements are less intrusive than most [[banner ads|banners]], and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website.

Many websites use AdSense to monetize their content; it is the most popular advertising network. AdSense has been particularly important for delivering advertising revenue to small websites that do not have the resources for developing advertising sales programs and sales people. To fill a website with advertisements that are relevant to the topics discussed, webmasters implement a brief script on the websites' pages. Websites that are content-rich have been very successful with this advertising program, as noted in a number of publisher case studies on the AdSense website.

Some webmasters invest significant effort into maximizing their own AdSense income. They do this in three ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
# They use a wide range of [[Web traffic|traffic]]-generating techniques, including but not limited to [[online advertising]].
# They build valuable content on their websites that attracts AdSense advertisements, which pay out the most when they are clicked.
# They use text content on their websites that encourages visitors to click on advertisements. Note that Google prohibits webmasters from using phrases like "Click on my AdSense ads" to increase click rates. The phrases accepted are "Sponsored Links" and "Advertisements".

The source of all AdSense income is the AdWords program, which in turn has a complex pricing model based on a [[Vickrey auction|Vickrey]] second price auction. AdSense commands an advertiser to submit a sealed bid (i.e., a bid not observable by competitors). Additionally, for any given click received, advertisers only pay one bid increment above the second-highest bid. Google currently shares 68% of revenues generated by AdSense with content network partners.<ref name="10QJul10">{{cite web | url=http://investor.google.com/documents/20100630_google_10Q.html | title=Google Form 10-Q, Q2 2010 | date=2010-07-15 | accessdate=2010-09-08}}</ref>

==History==
Oingo, Inc., a privately held company located in Los Angeles, was started in 1998 by Gilad Elbaz and Adam Weissman. Oingo developed a proprietary search algorithm that was based on word meanings and built upon an underlying lexicon called [[WordNet]], which was developed over the previous 15 years by researchers at [[Princeton University]], led by [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.infotoday.com/newsbreaks/nb1220-2.htm|title=Beyond Keyword Searching|publisher=Info Today|author=Paula J. Hane|date=1999-12-20}}</ref>

Oingo changed its name to [[Applied Semantics (company)]] in 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2196001|title=Google Buys Applied Semantics|publisher=Incisive Interactive Marketing LLC|date=2003-04-24}}</ref> which was later acquired by Google in April 2003 for US$102 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/applied.html|title=Google Acquires Applied Semantics|publisher=Press release|date=2003-04-23}}</ref>

In 2009, Google AdSense announced that it would now be offering new features, including the ability to "enable multiple networks to display ads".

==Types==
===AdSense for Feeds===
In May 2005, Google announced a limited-participation [[beta version]] of '''AdSense for Feeds''', a version of AdSense that runs on [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds that have more than 100 active subscribers. According to the Official Google Blog, "advertisers have their ads placed in the most appropriate feed articles; publishers are paid for their original content; readers see relevant advertising—and in the long run, more quality feeds to choose from."<ref name="google_blog_feed_me">{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/feed-me.html | title=Official Google Blog: Feed me | author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] | date=2005-05-17 | accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref>

AdSense for Feeds works by inserting images into a feed. When the image is displayed by a RSS reader or Web browser, Google writes the advertising content into the image that it returns. The advertisement content is chosen based on the content of the feed surrounding the image. When the user clicks the image, he or she is redirected to the advertiser's website in the same way as regular AdSense advertisements.

AdSense for Feeds remained in its beta state until August 15, 2008, when it became available to all AdSense users.

===AdSense for search===
A companion to the regular AdSense program, '''AdSense for search''', allows website owners to place Google search boxes on their websites. When a user searches the Internet or the website with the search box, Google shares 51% of the advertising revenue it makes from those searches with the website owner.<ref name="10QJul10"/> However the publisher is paid only if the advertisements on the page are clicked; AdSense does not pay publishers for mere searches.

===AdSense for mobile content===
AdSense for mobile content allows publishers to generate earnings from their [[mobile website]]s using targeted Google advertisements. Just like AdSense for content, Google matches advertisements to the content of a website — in this case, a mobile website.

===AdSense for domains===
Adsense for domains allows advertisements to be placed on domain names that have not been developed. 
This offers domain name owners a way to monetize domain names that are otherwise dormant.
Adsense for domains is currently being offered to some users, with plans to make it available to all in stages.

On December 12, 2008, ''[[TechCrunch]]'' reported that AdSense for Domains is available for all US publishers.<ref>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/12/adsense-for-domains-now-available-for-all-us-publishers/ AdSense For Domains Now Available For All US Publishers], Robin Wauters, Dec 12, 2008, TechCrunch</ref>

===AdSense for video===
AdSense for video allows publishers with video content to generate revenue using ad placements from Google's extensive [[Advertising network]] including popular [[Youtube]] videos.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-03/google-s-youtube-boosts-display-advertisers-10-fold-update1-.html | title = Google’s YouTube Boosts Display Advertisers 10-Fold (Update1) | author = Brian Womack | publisher = Bloomberg Businessweek | date = 2010-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}</ref>

==XHTML compatibility==
As of September 2007, the [[HTML]] code for the AdSense search box does not validate as [[XHTML]], and does not follow modern principles of website design because of its use of
* the [[HTML#Attributes|attribute]] <code>checked</code> rather than <code>checked="checked"</code>,
* presentational attributes other than <code>id</code>, <code>class</code>, or <code>style</code> — for example, <code>bgcolor</code> and <code>align</code>,
* a table structure for purely presentational (i.e., non-tabular) purposes,<sup>1</sup> and
* the <code>font</code> tag.<sup>2</sup>

<small>1: using a table structure for unintended purposes is strongly discouraged by the [[W3C]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html|title=Tables|author=W3C|accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> but nevertheless does not cause a document to fail validation — there is currently no algorithmic method of determining whether a table is used "correctly" (for displaying tabular data or for displaying elements, that get proportionally wider or narrower when browser window resizes in width without active client side scripting).<br />
2: the <code>font</code> tag is deprecated but does not fail validation in any XHTML standard{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.</small>

Additionally, the AdSense advertisement units use the JavaScript method <code>document.write()</code>, which does not work correctly when rendered with the <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> [[MIME type]]. The units also use the <code>[[iframe]]</code> HTML tag, which is not validated correctly with the ''XHTML 1.0 Strict'' or ''XHTML 1.0 Transitional'' [[Xhtml#DOCTYPEs|DOCTYPEs]].

The terms of the AdSense program forbid its [[affiliates]] from modifying the code, thus preventing these participants from having valid XHTML websites.

However, a workaround has been found by creating a separate HTML webpage containing only the AdSense advertisement units, and then importing this page into an XHTML webpage with an <code>object</code> tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/adsense.html|title=Adding AdSense to application/xhtml+xml pages|author=Stu Nicholls|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> This workaround appears to be accepted by Google.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200409/content_negotiation_adsense_and_comments/ | title=Content negotiation, AdSense, and comments | author=Roger Johansson | date=2004-09-01| accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

==How AdSense works==
* The webmaster inserts the AdSense JavaScript code into a webpage.
* Each time this page is visited, the JavaScript code uses inlined [[JSON]] to display content fetched from Google's servers.
* For [[:Contextual advertising|contextual advertisements]], Google's servers use a [[cache]] of the page to determine a set of high-value [[Keyword (Internet search)|keywords]]. If keywords have been cached already, advertisements are served for those keywords based on the AdWords bidding system. (More details are described in the [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=20040059708&amp;OS=20040059708&amp;RS=20040059708 AdSense patent].)
* For site-targeted advertisements, the advertiser chooses the page(s) on which to display advertisements, and pays based on [[cost per mille]] (CPM), or the price advertisers choose to pay for every thousand advertisements displayed.<ref>{{cite web

* [[#AdSense for search|Search advertisements]] are added to the list of results after the visitor performs a search.
* Because the JavaScript is sent to the Web browser when the page is requested, it is possible for other website owners to copy the JavaScript code into their own webpages. To protect against this type of fraud, AdSense customers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be shown. AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified.

==Abuse==
Some webmasters create websites tailored to lure searchers from Google and other engines onto their AdSense website to make money from clicks. These "zombie" websites often contain nothing but a large amount of interconnected, automated content (e.g., a directory with content from the [[Open Directory Project]], or [[scraper site|scraper websites]] relying on RSS feeds for content). Possibly the most popular form of such "AdSense farms" are [[splog]]s (spam blogs), which are centered around known high-paying keywords. Many of these websites use content from other websites, such as [[Wikipedia]], to attract visitors. These and related approaches are considered to be search engine [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and can be reported to Google. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

A [[Scraper site#Made for AdSense|Made for AdSense]] (MFA) website or webpage has little or no content, but is filled with advertisements so that users have no choice but to click on advertisements. Such pages were tolerated in the past, but due to complaints, Google now disables such accounts.

There have also been reports of [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] engineered to produce counterfeit Google advertisements that are formatted looking like legitimate ones. The Trojan uploads itself onto an unsuspecting user's computer through a webpage and then replaces the original advertisements with its own set of malicious advertisements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.techshout.com/internet/2005/27/a-trojan-horse-program-that-targets-google-ads-has-been-detected-by-an-indian-web-publisher/|title=Trojan Horse program that targets Google AdSense ads|publisher=TechShout|date=2005-12-27|author=Benaifer Jah}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Due to alleged concerns about [[click fraud]], Google AdSense has been criticized by some [[search engine optimization]] firms as a large source of what Google calls "invalid clicks", in which one company clicks on a rival's search engine advertisements to drive up the other company's costs.<ref>{{cite news

To help prevent click fraud, AdSense publishers can choose from a number of click-tracking programs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} These programs display detailed information about the visitors who click on the AdSense advertisements. Publishers can use this to determine whether or not they have been a victim of click fraud. There are a number of commercial tracking scripts available for purchase.

The payment terms for webmasters have also been criticized.<ref>{{cite news

but many micro content providers {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} require a long time—years in some cases—to build up this much AdSense revenue. However, Google will pay all earned revenue greater than US$10 when an AdSense account is closed and not disabled.

Many website owners complain that their AdSense accounts have been disabled just before they were supposed to receive their first paycheck from Google. Google claims accounts have been disabled due to click fraud or forbidden content, but have offered no proof of this. An automated email is sent to the publisher's owner which offers no reasoning, or options but a link to file an appeal. In the email, Google states that "Because we have a
responsibility to protect our AdWords advertisers from inflated costs due to invalid activity, we've found it necessary to disable your AdSense
account. Your outstanding balance and Google's share of the revenue will both be fully refunded back to the affected advertisers." The revenue generated - whether legitimate or not - is taken, and all complaints are deferred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=57153

Google came under fire when the official Google AdSense Blog showcased the French video website Imineo.com. This website violated Google's AdSense Program Policies by displaying AdSense alongside sexually explicit material. Typically, websites displaying AdSense have been banned from showing such content.<ref>{{cite news

It has been reported that using both AdSense and AdWords may cause a website to pay Google a commission when the website advertises itself.<ref>{{cite web

In some cases, AdSense displays inappropriate or offensive ads. For example, in a news story about a terrorist attack in [[India]], an advert was generated for a (presumably non-existent) educational qualification in terrorism.<ref>{{cite web

<title>AdaBoost</title>
<text>'''AdaBoost''', short for Adaptive [[Boosting]], is a [[machine learning]] algorithm, formulated by [[Yoav Freund]] and [[Robert Schapire]]<ref>Yoav Freund, Robert E. Schapire. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.9855 "A Decision-Theoretic Generalization of on-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting"], 1995</ref>. It is a [[meta-algorithm]], and can be used in conjunction with many other learning algorithms to improve their performance. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and [[outlier]]s. However in some problems it can be less susceptible to the [[overfitting (machine learning)|overfitting]] problem than most learning algorithms. 

AdaBoost calls a [[Boosting|weak classifier]] repeatedly in a series of rounds <math> t = 1,\ldots,T</math>. For each call a distribution of weights <math>D_{t}</math> is updated that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the classification. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified example are increased (or alternatively, the weights of each correctly classified example are decreased), so that the new classifier focuses more on those examples. 

== The algorithm for the binary classification task ==
Given: <math>(x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{m},y_{m})</math> where <math>x_{i} \in X,\, y_{i} \in Y = \{-1, +1\}</math>

Initialize <math>D_{1}(i) = \frac{1}{m}, i=1,\ldots,m.</math>

For <math>t = 1,\ldots,T</math>:

* Find the classifier <math>h_{t} : X \to \{-1,+1\}</math> that minimizes the error with respect to the distribution <math>D_{t}</math>:
: <math>h_{t} = \underset{h_{t} \in \mathcal{H}}{\operatorname{argmin}} \; \epsilon_{t}</math>, where <math> \epsilon_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} D_{t}(i)[y_i \ne h_{t}(x_{i})]</math>
* if <math>\epsilon_{t} \geq 0.5</math> then stop.
* Choose <math>\alpha_{t} \in \mathbb{R}</math>, typically <math>\alpha_{t}=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{ln}\frac{1-\epsilon_{t}}{\epsilon_{t}}</math> where <math>\epsilon_{t}</math> is the weighted error rate of classifier <math>h_{t}</math>.
* Update:
: <math>D_{t+1}(i) = \frac{ D_t(i) \exp(-\alpha_t y_i h_t(x_i)) }{ Z_t }</math><br/>
where <math>Z_{t}</math> is a normalization factor (chosen so that <math>D_{t+1}</math> will be a [[probability distribution]], i.e. sum one over all x).

Output the final classifier:

: <math>H(x) = \textrm{sign}\left( \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_{t}h_{t}(x)\right)</math>

The equation to update the distribution <math>D_{t}</math> is constructed so that:

: <math>- \alpha_{t} y_{i} h_{t}(x_{i}) \begin{cases} &amp;lt;0, &amp; y(i)=h_{t}(x_{i}) \\ &amp;gt;0, &amp; y(i) \ne h_{t}(x_{i}) \end{cases}</math>

Thus, after selecting an optimal classifier <math>h_{t} \,</math> for the distribution <math>D_{t} \,</math>, the examples <math>x_{i} \,</math> that the classifier <math>h_{t} \,</math> identified correctly are weighted less and those that it identified incorrectly are weighted more.  Therefore, when the algorithm is testing the classifiers on the distribution <math>D_{t+1} \,</math>, it will select a classifier that better identifies those examples that the previous classifer missed.

==Statistical Understanding of Boosting==

Boosting can be seen as minimization of a [[convex loss function]] over a [[convex set]] of functions. <ref>T. Zhang, "Statistical behavior and consistency of classification methods based on convex risk minimization", Annals of Statistics 32 (1), pp. 56-85, 2004.</ref> Specifically, the loss being minimized is the exponential loss

:<math>\sum_i e^{-y_i f(x_i)}</math>

and we are seeking a function

:<math>f = \sum_t \alpha_t h_t</math>

<title>Adaptive-additive algorithm</title>
<text>In the studies of [[Fourier optics]], [[sound synthesis]], [[Stellar astronomy|stellar]] [[interferometry]], [[optical tweezers]], and diffractive optical elements (DOEs) it is often important to know the [[spatial frequency]] phase of an observed wave source. In order to reconstruct this [[phase (waves)|phase]] the '''Adaptive-Additive Algorithm''' (or '''AA algorithm'''), which derives from a group of adaptive (input-output) algorithms, can be used. The AA algorithm is an [[iterative]] [[algorithm]] that utilizes the [[Fourier Transform]] to calculate an unknown part of a propagating wave, normally the [[spatial frequency]] [[phase (waves)|phase]] (k space). This can be done when given the phase’s known counterparts, usually an observed [[amplitude]] (position space) and an assumed starting [[amplitude]] (k space). To find the correct [[phase (waves)|phase]] the [[algorithm]] uses error conversion, or the error between the desired and the theoretical [[intensity (physics)|intensities]]. The AA algorithm is currently being implemented by Dr. Wendell Hill III, Alex Robel, V. Kotlyar Soifer, and David G Grier.

==The algorithm==
===History===

The adaptive-additive algorithm was originally created to reconstruct the [[spatial frequency]] [[phase (waves)|phase]] of light intensity in the study of stellar [[interferometry]]. Since then, the AA algorithm has been adapted to work in the fields of [[Fourier Optics]] by Soifer and Dr. Hill, [[soft matter]] and [[optical tweezers]] by Dr. Grier, and [[sound synthesis]] by Robel.

===Pseudo-code algorithm===

1. Define input amplitude and random phase

2. Forward Fourier Transform

3. Separate transformed amplitude and phase

4. Compare transformed amplitude/intensity to desired output amplitude/intensity

5. Check convergence conditions

6. Mix transformed amplitude with desired output amplitude and combine with transformed phase

7. Inverse Fourier Transform

8. Separate new amplitude and new phase

9. Combine new phase with original input amplitude

10. Loop back to Forward Fourier Transform

===Example===

For the problem of reconstructing the [[spatial frequency]] phase (''k''-space) for a desired [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] in the image plane (''x''-space). Assume the [[amplitude]] and the starting phase of the wave in ''k''-space is a <math>A_0</math> and <math>\phi_n^{k}</math> respectively. [[Fourier transform]] the wave in ''k''-space to ''x'' space.

: <math>A_0e^{i\phi_n^{k}} \xrightarrow{FFT} A_n^fe^{i\phi_n^{f}}</math>

Then compare the transformed [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] <math>I_n^f</math> with the desired intensity <math>I_0^f</math>, where

: <math>
I_n^f = \left(A_n^f\right)^2,
</math>

: <math>
\varepsilon = \sqrt{\left(I_n^f\right)^2 - \left(I_0\right)^2}.
</math>

Check <math>\varepsilon</math> against the convergence requirements. If the requirements are not met then mix the transformed [[amplitude]] <math>A_n^f</math> with desired amplitude <math>A^f</math>.

: <math>\bar{A}^f_n = \left[a A^f + (1-a) A_n^f\right],</math>

where ''a'' is mixing ratio and

: <math>A^f = \sqrt{I_0}</math>.

''Note that ''a'' is a percentage, defined on the interval 0 ≤ ''a'' ≤ 1.

Combine mixed amplitude with the ''x''-space phase and [[inverse Fourier transform]].

: <math>\bar{A}^{f}e^{i\phi_n^f} \xrightarrow{iFFT} \bar{A}_n^ke^{i\phi_n^k}.</math>

Separate <math>\bar{A}_n^k</math> and <math>\phi^k_n</math> and combine <math>A_0</math> with <math>\phi^k_n</math>. Increase loop by one <math> n \to n + 1</math> and repeat.

====Limits====
* If <math>a = 1</math> then the AA algorithm becomes the [[Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm]].
* If <math>a = 0</math> then <math>\bar{A}^k_n = A_0</math>.

<title>Adaptive sort</title>
<text>A [[sorting algorithm]] falls into the '''adaptive sort''' family if it takes advantage of existing order in its input.  It benefits from the presortedness in the input sequence – or a limited amount of [[randomness|disorder]] for various definitions of measures of disorder – and sorts faster.  Adaptive sorting is usually performed by modifying existing sorting algorithms.

== Motivation ==
[[Comparison sort|Comparison-based sorting algorithms]] have traditionally dealt with achieving an optimal bound of [[Big O notation|O]](n logn) when dealing with [[time complexity]].  Adaptive sort takes advantage of the existing order of the input to try to achieve better times, so that the time taken by the algorithm to sort is a smoothly growing function of the size of the sequence ''and'' the disorder in the sequence.  In other words, the more presorted the input is, the faster it should be sorted.

This is an attractive algorithm because nearly sorted sequences are common in practice.  Thus, the performance of existing sort algorithms can be improved by taking into account the existing order in the input.  

Note that the most worst-case sorting algorithms that do optimally well in the worst-case, notably [[heap sort]] and [[merge sort]], do not take existing order within their input into account, although this deficiency is easily rectified in the case of [[merge sort]] by checking if left.last_item ≤ right.first_item, in which case a merge operation may be replaced by simple concatenation – a modification that is well within the scope of making an algorithm adaptive.

== Examples ==
A classic example of an adaptive sorting algorithm is ''Straight Insertion Sort''.  In this sorting algorithm, we scan the input from left to right, repeatedly finding the position of the current item, and insert it into an array of previously sorted items.

In [[pseudo-code]] form, the ''Straight Insertion Sort'' algorithm could look something like this:

  '''procedure''' ''Straight Insertion Sort (X, n)'':
  ''X[0]'' := − ∞;
  '''for''' j := 2 '''to''' n '''do'''
  '''begin''' i := j − 1;
        t := ''X[j]'';
        '''while''' t &amp;lt; ''X[i]'' '''do'''
        '''begin''' ''X[i + 1]'' := ''X[i]'';
              i := i - 1
        '''end''';
        ''X[i + 1]'' := t;
  '''end;'''

The performance of this algorithm can be described in terms of the number of [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversions]] in the input, and then T(n) will be roughly equal to I(A) + (n - 1), where I(A) is the number of Inversions.  Using this measure of presortedness – being relative to the number of inversions – ''Straight Insertion Sort'' takes less time to sort the closer it is to being sorted.

Other examples of adaptive sorting algorithms are [[Adaptive heap sort|Adaptive Heap-Sort]] and [[Adaptive Merge-Sort]].  Dijkstra’s [[Smoothsort]] algorithm is a variation on heap-sort that is also considered an adaptive sorting algorithm.

[[Timsort]], used as the generic sorting algorithm for several programming languages including Python, is adaptive.<ref>{{Cite web

<title>Address bus</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=June 2009}}

An '''address bus''' is a [[computer bus]] (a series of lines connecting two or more devices) that is used to specify a [[memory address|physical address]]. When a [[central processing unit|processor]] or [[direct memory access|DMA]]-enabled device needs to read or write to a memory location, it specifies that memory location on the address bus (the value to be read or written is sent on the [[data bus]]). The width of the address bus determines the amount of memory a system can address. For example, a system with a 32-bit address bus can address 2<sup>32</sup> (4,294,967,296) memory locations. If each memory address holds one bit, the addressable memory space is 4 GB.

==Implementation==
Early processors used a wire for each bit of the address width. For example, a 16-bit address bus had 16 physical wires making up the bus. As the buses became wider, this approach became expensive in terms of the number of chip pins and board traces.  Beginning with the [[Mostek]] 4096 DRAM, multiplexed addressing became common.  In a multiplexed address scheme, the address is sent in two equal parts. This halves the number of address bus signals required to connect to the memory. For example a 32-bit address bus can be implemented by using 16 wires and sending the first half of the memory address, immediately followed by the second half.

==Interesting examples==
Accessing an individual byte frequently requires reading or writing the full bus width (a ''[[word (computing)|word]]'') at once. In these instances the least significant bits of the address bus may not even be implemented - it is instead the responsibility of the controlling device to isolate the individual byte required from the complete word transmitted.  This is the case, for instance, with the [[VESA Local Bus]] which lacks the two least significant bits, limiting this bus to [[Data structure alignment|aligned]] 32-bit transfers.

Historically, there were also some examples of computers which were only able to address words.

<title>Address space layout randomization</title>
<text>{{Original research|date=October 2008}}
{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

'''Address space layout randomization''' ('''ASLR''') is a [[Computer insecurity|computer security]] technique which involves randomly arranging the positions of key data areas, usually including the base of the [[executable]] and position of [[Library (computer science)|libraries]], [[Dynamic memory allocation|heap]], and [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]], in a [[Process (computer science)|process]]'s [[address space]].

== Benefits ==
Address space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses.  For example, attackers trying to execute [[return-to-libc attack]]s must locate the code to be executed, while other attackers trying to execute [[shellcode]] injected on the stack have to find the stack first.  In both cases, the related memory addresses are obscured from the attackers. These values have to be guessed, and a mistaken guess is not usually recoverable due to the application crashing.

=== Effectiveness ===
Address space layout randomization relies on the low chance of an attacker guessing where randomly-placed areas are located. Security is increased by increasing the search space.  Thus, address space randomization is more effective when more [[Information entropy|entropy]] is present in the random offsets.  Entropy is increased by either raising the amount of [[virtual memory|virtual memory area]] space over which the randomization occurs or reducing the period over which the randomization occurs. The period is typically implemented as small as possible, so most systems must increase VMA space randomization.

To defeat the randomization, attackers must successfully guess the positions of all areas they wish to attack.  For data areas such as stack and heap, where custom code or useful data can be loaded, more than one state can be attacked by using [[NOP slide]]s for code or repeated copies of data. This allows an attack to succeed if the area is randomized to one of a handful of values.  In contrast, code areas such as library base and main executable need to be discovered exactly.  Often these areas are mixed, for example [[stack frame]]s are injected onto the stack and a library is returned into.

To begin, let us declare the following variables:

:<math>E_s = \mbox{entropy bits of stack top}\,</math>
:<math>E_m = \mbox{entropy bits of mmap() base}\,</math>
:<math>E_x = \mbox{entropy bits of main executable base}\,</math>
:<math>E_h = \mbox{entropy bits of heap base}\,</math>
:<math>A_s = \mbox{attacked bits per attempt of stack entropy}\,</math>
:<math>A_m = \mbox{attacked bits per attempt of mmap() base entropy}\,</math>
:<math>A_x = \mbox{attacked bits per attempt of main executable entropy}\,</math>
:<math>A_h = \mbox{attacked bits per attempt of heap base entropy}\,</math>
:<math>\alpha = \mbox{attempts made}\,</math>
:<math>N = E_s-A_s + E_m-A_m + E_x-A_x + E_h-A_h\,</math>

To calculate the probability of an attacker succeeding, we have to assume a number of attempts <math>\alpha</math> carried out without being interrupted by a signature-based IPS, law enforcement, or other factor; in the case of brute forcing, the daemon cannot be restarted.  We also have to figure out how many bits are relevant and how many are being attacked in each attempt, leaving however many bits the attacker has to defeat.

The following formulas represent the probability of success for a given set of <math>\alpha\,</math> attempts on <math>N</math> bits of entropy.

:<math>g \left ( \alpha\, \right ) = \mbox{isolated guessing; address space is re-randomized after each attempt}\,</math>
:<math>g \left ( \alpha\, \right ) = 1 - { \left ( 1 - {2^{-N}} \right ) ^ \alpha\,} : 0 \le \, \alpha\,</math>

:<math>b \left ( \alpha\, \right ) = \mbox{systematic brute forcing on copies of the program with the same address space}</math>
:<math>b \left ( \alpha\, \right ) = \frac{\alpha\,}{{2^N}} : 0 \le \, \alpha\, \le \, {2^N}</math>

In many systems, <math>2^N</math> can be in the thousands or millions; on {{as of | 2009 | alt = modern}} [[64-bit]] systems, these numbers typically reach the millions at least. For 32-bit systems at 2004 computer speeds which have 16 bits for address randomization, Shacham and co-workers state "… 16 bits of address randomization can be defeated by a [[brute force attack]] within minutes."<ref>On the Effectiveness of Address-Space Randomization,Shacham, H. and Page, M. and Pfaff, B. and Goh, E.J. and Modadugu, N. and Boneh, D,Proceedings of the 11th ACM conference on Computer and communications security,pp 298--307, 2004</ref>  It should be noted that the authors' statement depends on the ability to attack the same application multiple times without any delay.  Proper implementations of ASLR, like that included in [[grsecurity]], provide several methods to make such brute force attacks infeasible.  One method involves preventing an executable from executing for a configurable amount of time if it has crashed a certain number of times.

Some systems implement ''Library Load Order Randomization'', a form of ASLR which randomizes the order in which libraries are loaded.  This supplies very little entropy.  An approximation of the number of bits of entropy supplied per needed library is shown below; this does not yet account for varied library sizes, so the actual entropy gained is really somewhat higher.  Note that attackers usually need only one library; the math is more complex with multiple libraries, and shown below as well.  Note that the case of an attacker using only one library is a simplification of the more complex formula for <math>l = 1</math>.

:<math> l = \mbox{number of libraries loaded}</math>
:<math> \beta\, = \mbox{number of libraries used by the attacker}</math>

:<math>E_m = \log_2 \left (l \right ) : \beta\, = 1, l \ge \, 1</math>
:<math>E_m = \sum_{i=l}^{l - \left ( \beta\, - 1 \right )} \log_2 \left (i \right ) : \beta\, \ge \, 1, l \ge \, 1</math>

These values tend to be low even for large values of <math>l</math>, most importantly since attackers typically can use only the [[C standard library]] and thus one can often assume that <math>\beta\, = 1</math>.  Interestingly, however, even for a small number of libraries there are a few bits of entropy gained here; it is thus potentially interesting to combine library load order randomization with VMA address randomization to gain a few extra bits of entropy.  Note that these extra bits of entropy will not apply to other mmap() segments, only libraries.

==== Reducing entropy ====
Attackers may make use of several methods to reduce the entropy present in a randomized address space, ranging from simple information leaks to attacking multiple bits of entropy per attack (such as by [[heap spraying]]).  There is little that can be done about this.

It is possible to leak information about memory layout using [[format string vulnerability|format string vulnerabilities]].  Format string functions such as [[printf]]() use a [[variable argument list]] to do their job; format specifiers describe what the argument list looks like.  Because of the way arguments are typically passed, each format specifier moves closer to the top of the stack frame.  Eventually, the return pointer and stack frame pointer can be extracted, revealing the address of a vulnerable library and the address of a known stack frame; this can completely eliminate library and stack randomization as an obstacle to an attacker.

One can also decrease entropy in the stack or heap.  The stack typically must be aligned to 16 bytes, and so this is the smallest possible randomization interval; while the heap must be page-aligned, typically 4096 bytes.  When attempting an attack, it is possible to align duplicate attacks with these intervals; a [[NOP slide]] may be used with shellcode injection, and the string '/bin/sh' can be replaced with '////////bin/sh' for an arbitrary number of slashes when attempting to return to ''system()''.  The number of bits removed is exactly <math>log_2 \left (n \right )</math> for <math>n</math> intervals attacked.

Such decreases are limited due to the amount of data in the stack or heap.  The stack, for example, is typically limited to 8 [[Megabyte|MB]]<ref name="Prefix2">{{BDprefix|p=b}}</ref> and grows to much less; this allows for at most 19 bits, although a more conservative estimate would be around 8–10 bits corresponding to 4–16 [[Kilobyte|KB]]<ref name="Prefix2">{{BDprefix|p=b}}</ref> of stack stuffing.  The heap on the other hand is limited by the behavior of the memory allocator; in the case of [[glibc]], allocations above 128 KB are created using [[mmap]](), limiting attackers to 5 bits of reduction.  This is also a limiting factor when brute forcing; although the number of attacks to perform can be reduced, the size of the attacks is increased enough that the behavior could in some circumstances become analogous to [[intrusion detection systems]].

== History ==
The [[PaX]] project first coined the term "ASLR".  It published the first design and implementation of ASLR in July, 2001.  This remains the most complete implementation, providing also kernel stack randomization from October 2002 onward.  It also continues to provide the most entropy for each randomized layout compared to other implementations.<ref>Comparison of PaX to ExecShield and W^X</ref>

== Implementations ==
Several mainstream, general-purpose operating systems implement ASLR.

=== OpenBSD ===
[[OpenBSD]] became the first mainstream operating systems to support ASLR (and to activate it by default).<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.openbsd.org/papers/ven05-deraadt/index.html
|title=Exploit Mitigation Techniques (updated to include random malloc and mmap)  at OpenCON 2005
|author=Theo De Raadt
|year=2005
|accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>

=== Linux ===
[[Linux]] has enabled a weak<ref>http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pwn2own-mac-hack,2254-4.html</ref> form of ASLR by default since kernel version 2.6.12 (released June 2005). The [[PaX]] and [[ExecShield]] patchsets to the Linux kernel provide more complete implementations. Various Linux distributions including ''[[Adamantix]]'', ''[[Alpine Linux]]'', ''[[Hardened Gentoo]]'', and ''[[Hardened Linux From Scratch]]'' come with PaX's implementation of ASLR by default.

The [[Exec Shield]] patch for Linux supplies 19 bits of stack entropy on a period of 16 bytes; and 8 bits of mmap() base randomization on a period of 1 page of 4096 bytes.  This places the stack base in an area 8 MB wide containing 524 288 possible positions; and the mmap() base in an area 1 MB wide containing 256 possible positions.

[[Position-independent_code#Position-independent_executables|Position-independent executable (PIE)]] feature implements random base address for the main executable binary since 2003.  It provides the same address randomness to the main executable as being used for the shared libraries.  The PIE feature is in use only for the network facing daemons – the PIE feature cannot be used together with the [[prelink]] feature for the same executable.

The [[prelink]] tool implements randomization at prelink time rather than runtime, because by design prelink aims to handle relocating libraries before the dynamic linker has to, which allows the relocation to occur once for many runs of the program. As a result, real address space randomization would defeat the purpose of prelinking.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] (released January 2007), [[Windows Server 2008]], [[Windows 7]], and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] have ASLR enabled by default, although only for those executables and [[dynamic link library|dynamic link libraries]] specifically linked to be ASLR-enabled.<ref>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb430720.aspx</ref> This did not include [[Internet Explorer 7]] on Windows Vista prior to Service Pack 1; ASLR and [[Data Execution Prevention|DEP]] are both disabled for application compatibility purposes.<ref>{{cite web

The locations of the [[Dynamic memory allocation|heap]], [[Call stack|stack]], Process Environment Block, and [[Win32 Thread Information Block|Thread Environment Block]] are also randomized. A security whitepaper from Symantec noted that ASLR in 32-bit Windows Vista may not be as robust as expected, and Microsoft has acknowledged a weakness in its implementation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/Address_Space_Layout_Randomization.pdf |format=PDF |title=An Analysis of Address Space Layout Randomization on Windows Vista |author=Ollie Whitehouse |month=February |year=2007}}</ref>

<title>Adiabatic quantum computation</title>
<text>'''Adiabatic quantum computation''' relies on the [[adiabatic theorem]] to do calculations.<ref name="Farhi2000">
{{cite arXiv |author= [[Edward Farhi]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], [[Sam Gutmann]], [[Michael Sipser]] |eprint=quant-ph/0001106 |title=Quantum Computation by Adiabatic Evolution |year=2000 |version=v1 |accessdate=2007-11-26 }}</ref>  First, a complex [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is found whose ground state describes the solution to the problem of interest.  Next, a system with a simple Hamiltonian is prepared and initialized to the ground state.  Finally, the simple Hamiltonian is adiabatically evolved to the complex Hamiltonian.  By the adiabatic theorem, the system remains in the ground state, so at the end the state of the system describes the solution to the problem.

AQC is a possible method to get around the problem of [[Quantum_computer#Quantum_decoherence | quantum decoherence]]. Since the quantum system is in the ground state, interference with the outside world cannot make it move to a lower state. If the energy of the outside world (that is, the "temperature of the bath") is kept lower than the energy gap between the ground state and the next higher energy state, the system has a proportionally lower probability of going to a higher energy state. Thus the system can stay coherent as long as needed.

In practice, there are problems during a computation. As the Hamiltonian is gradually changed, the interesting parts (quantum behaviour as opposed to classical) occur when multiple [[qubit]]s are close to a tipping point. It is exactly at this point when the ground state (one set of qubit orientations) gets arbitrarily close to a first energy state (a different arrangement of orientations). Adding a slight amount of energy (from the external bath, or as a result of slowly changing the Hamiltonian) could take the system out of the ground state, and ruin the calculation. Trying to perform the calculation more quickly increases the external energy; scaling the number of qubits makes the energy gap at the tipping points smaller.

<title>Adjoint state method</title>
<text>{{primarysources|date=January 2010}}
The '''adjoint state method''' is a [[numerical method]] for computing the [[gradient]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] or [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] in a numerical optimization problem.  It has applications in [[geophysics]] and [[seismic imaging]].

The adjoint state space is chosen to simplify the physical interpretation of equation constraints.<ref name='symes_tr94'>Alain Sei &amp; William Symes. ''Gradient Calculation of the Traveltime Cost Function Without Ray-tracing.'' Expanded Abstracts, 65th Annual [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] (SEG) Meeting and Exposition, pages 1351–1354 ([http://www.caam.rice.edu/caam/trs/94/TR94-15.pdf Available online])</ref> It may take the form of a [[Hilbert space]].

Adjoint state techniques allow the use of [[integration by parts]], resulting in a form which explicitly contains the physically interesting quantity.  An adjoint state equation is introduced, including a new unknown variable.

<title>Adjunction space</title>
<text>In [[mathematics]], an '''adjunction space''' is a common construction in [[topology]] where one [[topological space]] is attached or "glued" onto another. Specifically, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be a topological spaces with ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''Y''. Let ''f'' : ''A'' → ''X'' be a [[continuous (topology)|continuous map]] (called the '''attaching map'''). One forms the adjunction space ''X'' ∪<sub>''f''</sub> ''Y'' by taking the [[disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] of ''X'' and ''Y'' and [[quotient space|identifying]] ''x'' with ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''. Schematically,

:<math>X\cup_f Y = (X\amalg Y) / \{f(A) \sim A\}.</math> 

Sometimes, the adjunction is written as <math>X+\!_f \,Y</math>. Intuitively, we think of ''Y'' as being glued onto ''X'' via the map ''f''.

As a set, ''X'' ∪<sub>''f''</sub> ''Y'' consists of the disjoint union of ''X'' and (''Y'' − ''A''). The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. In the case where ''A'' is a [[closed set|closed]] subspace of ''Y'' one can show that the map ''X'' → ''X'' ∪<sub>''f''</sub> ''Y'' is a closed [[embedding]] and (''Y'' − ''A'') → ''X'' ∪<sub>''f''</sub> ''Y'' is an open embedding.

==Examples==
*A common example of an adjunction space is given when ''Y'' is a closed ''n''-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]] (or ''cell'') and ''A'' is the boundary of the ball, the (''n''−1)-[[sphere]]. Inductively attaching cells along their spherical boundaries to this space results in an example of a [[CW complex]].
*Adjunction spaces are also used to define [[connected sum]]s of [[manifold]]s. Here, one first removes open balls from ''X'' and ''Y'' before attaching the boundaries of the removed balls along an attaching map.
*If ''A'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the [[wedge sum]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.
*If ''X'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the quotient ''Y''/''A''.

==Categorical description==
The attaching construction is an example of a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. That is to say, the adjunction space is [[universal property|universal]] with respect to following [[commutative diagram]]:

<div style="text-align: center;">
[[Image:AdjunctionSpace-01.svg]]
</div>

Here ''i'' is the [[inclusion map]] and φ<sub>''X''</sub>, φ<sub>''Y''</sub> are the maps obtained by composing the quotient map with the canonical injections into the disjoint union of ''X'' and ''Y''. One can form a more general pushout by replacing ''i'' with an arbitrary continuous map ''g'' &amp;mdash; the construction is similar. Conversely, if ''f'' is also an inclusion the attaching construction is to simply glue ''X'' and ''Y'' together along their common subspace.

'''Adminer''' is a tool for managing content in [[MySQL]] databases. Adminer is distributed under [[Apache license]] in a form of a single [[PHP]] file (currently approx. 160 KiB in size). Its author is Jakub Vrána who (during 2007) decided to develop such tool as an "light-weight" alternative to [[phpMyAdmin]]. Currently (August 2009), the tool is in version 2.0 and so far it exceeded phpMyAdmin in some of the features it offers. Also, first webhosting providers <!--flyweb.cz, webhosting-c4.cz, gtny.org...--> started to include Adminer as MySQL managing tool into their portfolio of services.

==Features==
* Users log in specifying the destination server and providing the user name and password (which is stored during whole session)
* Basic functions: select [[database]], select/edit tables, browse/insert/edit table rows
* Searching or sorting via multiple columns
* Editing of other database objects: [[view (database)|views]], [[trigger (database)|triggers]], [[event (computing)|event]]s, [[stored procedure]]s, processes, mysql variables, [[user permission]]s
* Text area for arbitrary SQL commands and storing these commands in command history
* Export of databases and tables (its structures and/or data) as a dump to output or a downloadable attachment
* [[User-friendly]] interface (extensive employment of [[JavaScript]])
* Multiple language support (English, German, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Estonian, Chinese, Czech, Slovak, Russian)
* [[SQL]] [[syntax highlighting]]
* Visual database/[[E-R]] schema editing
* [[XHTML]] 1.1 validity in [[UTF-8]]
* Countermeasures against [[XSS]], [[CSRF]], [[SQL injection]], [[session stealing]], …
* "Light-weight" - released in a form of a single file, approx. 160 KiB in size, with support of [[CSS]] skins

The small single file is a result of compilation and minification of source codes. <ref>{{Citation

<title>Admissible heuristic</title>
<text>In [[computer science]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''admissible''' if it is no more than the lowest-cost path to the goal. In other words, a heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal.<ref>{{cite book
 | author = Russell, S.J.
 | coauthors = Norvig, P.
 | year = 2002
 | title = [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]
 | publisher = Prentice Hall
 | isbn = 0137903952
}}</ref> An admissible heuristic is also known as an '''optimistic heuristic'''.

==Search Algorithm==
An admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost of reaching the goal state in an [[informed search algorithm]]. In order for a heuristic to be admissible to the search problem, the estimated cost must always be lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state. The search algorithm uses the admissible heuristic to find an estimated optimal path to the goal state from the current node. 
For example, in [[A* search]] the evaluation function (where <math>n</math> is the current node) is:

<math>f(n)</math> = <math>g(n)</math> + <math>h(n)</math>

where
:<math>f(n)</math> = the evaluation function.
:<math>g(n)</math> = the cost from the start node to the current node
:<math>h(n)</math> = estimated cost from current node to goal.

<math>h(n)</math> is calculated using the heuristic function. With a non-admissible heuristic, the A* algorithm would overlook the optimal solution to a search problem due to an overestimation in <math>f(n)</math>.

==Formulation==

: <math>n</math> is a node
: <math>h</math> is a heuristic
: <math>h(n)</math> is cost indicated by <math>h</math> to reach a goal from <math>n</math>
: <math>C(n)</math> is the actual cost to reach a goal from n

: <math>h</math> is admissible if

:: <math>\forall n, h(n) \leq C(n)</math>

==Construction==
An admissible heuristic can be derived from a relaxed
version of the problem, or by information from pattern databases that store exact solutions to subproblems of the problem, or by using [[Inductive transfer|inductive learning]] methods.

==Notes==
While all [[consistent heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.

For tree search problems, if an admissible heuristic is used, the [[A* search algorithm]] will never return a suboptimal goal node.

__NOTOC__ <!-- this hides the "Table of Contents", remove this as soon as there is a lot of content or many paragraphs with headings -->

'''Admon''' is a [[Zabbix]]-based [[open-source]] [[computer system]] and [[network monitoring]] [[application software]]. It watches [[node (networking)|host]]s and services specified by users, alerting them via e-mail or short-message service when issues arise.

Created under [[Zabbix]] v1.1.1 beta, Admon was modified to run under [[Linux]] only, but it also runs on other [[Unix]] variants. Admon is [[free software]] licensed under a [[GNU General Public License]], version 2, as published by the [[Free Software Foundation]].

Compared to Zabbix, most of the original functions have been shrunk, including supports for windows, multiple databases, [[simple network management protocol]], and auto-discovery; and only some core functions are reserved. Its alerting subsystem has been rewritten for easier use in large-scale networks. Admon is a smart version of Zabbix, and more reliable. {{Fact|date=January 2009}}  It is maintained by [http://admon.org/ Admon.org].

'''Adobe Director''' (formerly '''''Macromedia Director''''') is a multimedia application authoring platform created by [[Macromedia]]&amp;mdash;now part of [[Adobe Systems]]. It allows users to build applications built on a movie [[interface metaphor|metaphor]], with the user as the "director" of the movie. Originally designed for creating animation sequences, the addition of a powerful scripting language called [[Lingo (programming language)|Lingo]] made it a popular choice for creating CD-ROMs and standalone kiosks and web content using Adobe [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]. Adobe Director supports both 2D and 3D multimedia projects.

== Comparing Director to Flash ==
The differences between these two products has been the subject of much discussion, especially in the Director development community. Extensibility is one of the main differences between the two, as are some of the sundry codecs that can be imported.  Director has tended to be the larger of the two, but that footprint has been part of its weakness. This weakness manifest into the erosion of Director's ubiquity as the leader of authoring tools, especially in the critical window of 1998 - 2000.  The download footprint of the Director Shockwave plugin was significantly larger than the Shockwave Flash download footprint.  Additionally, Macromedia partnered with distributors such as Dell, Apple, etc. to have the Flash plugin pre-installed on machines for users, so that they would not be prompted to install any additional software.  At that point in time (1998–2000), broadband internet access was not the norm for most users, and the fivefold difference in size was catastrophic.

==History==
Director started out as [[MacroMind]] "VideoWorks", an application for the original [[Apple Macintosh]]. Animations were initially limited to the black and white of early Macintosh screens.

The name was changed to "Director" in 1987, with the addition of new capabilities and the Lingo scripting language in 1988. A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version was available in the early 1990s.

From 1995 to 1997 a competing multimedia authoring program appeared called mTropolis (from mFactory). In 1997 mTropolis was purchased and buried by Quark, who had its own plans into multimedia authoring with Quark Immedia.

<title>Adobe Flash</title>
<text>'''Adobe Flash''' (formerly '''Macromedia Flash''') is a [[multimedia]] [[Platform (computing)|platform]] used to add [[animation]], video, and [[interactivity]] to web pages. Flash is frequently used for advertisements and games. More recently, it has been positioned as a tool for "[[Rich Internet Application]]s" ("RIAs").

Flash manipulates [[vector graphics|vector]] and [[raster graphics]] to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It supports bidirectional [[Streaming media|streaming]] of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera. Flash contains an [[Object-oriented language]] called [[ActionScript]].

Flash content may be displayed on various computer systems and [[information appliance|devices]], using [[Adobe Flash Player]], which is available free of charge for common [[web browser]]s, some [[mobile phone]]s and a few other [[electronic device]]s (using [[Flash Lite]]).

Some users feel that Flash enriches their web experience, while others find the extensive use of Flash animation, particularly in advertising, intrusive and annoying, giving rise to a cottage industry that specializes in blocking Flash content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tnerd.com/2010/02/18/how-to-block-flash-on-chrome-firefox-opera-internet-explorer-8/ |title=How to Block Flash |accessdate=2011-01-04 }}</ref> Flash has also been criticized for adversely affecting the usability of web pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad |accessdate=2011-01-08 }}</ref>

==History==
Originally developed by [[Macromedia]], Flash was introduced in 1996, and is currently developed and distributed by [[Adobe Systems]]. The precursor to the Flash application was SmartSketch, a drawing application for pen computers running the [[PenPoint OS]] developed by [[Jonathan Gay]], who began working on it in college and extended the idea for [[Silicon Beach Software]] and its successors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashmagazine.com/413.htm |title=The Flash History |accessdate=2001-06-18 |last=Waldron |first=Rick |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-08-27 |work= |publisher=Flashmagazine |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2009-10-18}}</ref> When PenPoint failed in the marketplace, SmartSketch was ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. With the [[Internet]] becoming more popular, SmartSketch was re-released as FutureSplash, a [[Vector graphics|vector]]-based [[web animation]] in competition with Macromedia [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]. In 1995, SmartSketch was further modified with frame-by-frame animation features and re-released as [[FutureSplash Animator]] on multiple platforms.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://coldhardflash.com/2008/02/grandmasters-of-flash-an-interview-with-the-creators-of-flash.html | title=Grandmasters of Flash: An Interview with the Creators of Flash | accessdate=2008-02-12 | publisher=ColdHardFlash.com}}</ref> The product was offered to Adobe and used by [[Microsoft]] in its early work with the Internet ([[MSN]]). In 1996, FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia and released as '''Flash,''' contracting "Future" and "Splash".

===Recent developments===
<!-- Notice to editors: if possible, try to get third party references which are not simple copies of Adobe press releases. The section is also prone to original research and crystal balling which quickly becomes out of date -->

'''Adobe Labs''' (previously called ''Macromedia Labs'') is a source for news and pre-release versions of emerging products and technologies from Adobe. Most innovations, such as Flash 10, [[Macromedia Flex|Flex]] 3, and ActionScript 3.0 have all been discussed and/or trialled on the site.

One area Adobe is focusing on (as of February 2009) is the deployment of [[Rich Internet Applications]] (RIAs). To this end, they released [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] (AIR), a [[cross-platform]] [[runtime environment]] which can be used to build, using Adobe Flash, rich Internet applications that can be deployed as [[application software|desktop applications]].

Two additional components designed for large-scale implementation have been proposed by Adobe for future releases of Flash: first, the option to require an ad to be played in full before the main video piece is played; and second, the integration of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) capabilities. This way Adobe can give companies the option to link an advertisement with content and make sure that both are played and remain unchanged.<ref name="BBCVideoControl">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6558979.stm |title=Adobe unveils Flash video control |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2007-04-16 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

====Open Screen Project====
On May 1, 2008 Adobe announced ''Open Screen Project'', which hopes to provide a consistent application interface across devices such as [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile device]]s and [[consumer electronics]].<ref name="osppr">{{cite web|title=Adobe and Industry Leaders Establish Open Screen Project|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200805/050108AdobeOSP.html|accessdate=2009-02-20|date=2008-05-01}}</ref> When the project was announced, several goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]], the removal of restrictions on the use of the [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) [[file format]], the publishing of [[Application Programming Interface|application programming interfaces]] for porting Flash to new devices and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.<ref name="osppr"/>

As of February 2009, the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV/F4V specs have been published.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.uiresourcecenter.com/rich-internet-applications/articles/inside-the-open-screen-project.html?s=2_1 |title=Inside the Open Screen Project |first=Anup| last=Murarka|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> The Flash Cast protocol—now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol—and AMF protocols have also been made available,<ref name="interview"/> with AMF available as an open source implementation, [[BlazeDS]]. Work on the device porting layers is in the early stages. Adobe intends to remove the licensing fees for Flash Player and Adobe AIR for devices at their release for the Open Screen Project.

==Format==
{{main|SWF}}
Flash files are in the ''SWF'' format, traditionally called "'''S'''hock'''W'''ave '''F'''lash" movies, "Flash movies," or "Flash applications", usually have a .swf [[file extension]], and may be used in the form of a web page plug-in, strictly "played" in a [[standalone]] Flash Player, or incorporated into a self-executing Projector movie (with the .exe extension in [[Microsoft Windows]]). [[Flash Video]] files<ref group="spec">FLV and F4V [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flv/pdf/video_file_format_spec_v9.pdf Video File Format Specification Version 9]<br />F4V is based on [[ISO base media file format]] standard:[http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c051533_ISO_IEC_14496-12_2008.zip freely available ISO standards] , and also available via subscription [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=41828]</ref> have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .[[swf]] files or played through a flv-aware player, such as [[VLC media player|VLC]], or [[QuickTime]] and [[Windows Media Player]] with external [[codec]]s added.

The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller — and thus for streams to use less [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] — than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less [[central processing unit|CPU]] power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades.

In addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, support for video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offers two video codecs: [[On2 Technologies]] [[VP6]] and [[sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], and run-time support for [[JPEG]], Progressive JPEG, [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]]. In the next version, Flash is slated to use a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] compiler for the ActionScript engine.

Flash Player is a browser plugin, and cannot run within a usual e-mail client, such as [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]]. Instead, a link must open a browser window. A [[Gmail]] labs feature allows playback of YouTube videos linked in emails.

===Flash Video===
{{Main|Flash Video}}
Virtually all browser plugins for video are [[Gratis#Software|free of charge]] and cross-platform, including Adobe's offering of Flash Video, which was first introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large [[#Installed user base|installed user base]] and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple [[#Criticism|publicly criticized]] Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash is not to be found on Apple's mobile devices. Soon after Apple's criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, finally adds multicore CPU hardware acceleration for h.264, three years after most other decoders.

===Flash Audio===
Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in [[MP3]] or AAC ([[Advanced Audio Coding]]) however it does also support [[ADPCM]], Nellymoser ([[Nellymoser Asao Codec]]) and [[Speex]] audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 11, 22 and 44.1 kHz. It does not support 48 kHz audio sample rate which is the standard TV, DVD sample rate.

On August 20, 2007, Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9, Flash Video will also support some parts of the [[MPEG-4]] international standards.<ref name="MP4">{{cite web
|url=http://www.kaourantin.net/2007/08/what-just-happened-to-video-on-web_20.html
|title=What just happened to video on the web
|publisher=Adobe
}}</ref> Specifically, Flash Player will have support for video compressed in [[H.264]] (MPEG-4 Part 10), audio compressed using [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] (MPEG-4 Part 3), the F4V, [[MP4]] (MPEG-4 Part 14), M4V, M4A, [[3GP]] and [[MOV]] multimedia [[Container format (digital)|container formats]], [[3GPP]] [[Timed Text]] specification (MPEG-4 Part 17) which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing support for the 'ilst' atom which is the [[ID3]] equivalent [[iTunes]] uses to store [[metadata]]. [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] and [[H.263]] will not be supported in F4V file format. Adobe also announced that they will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format ([[MPEG-4 Part 12]]) owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264. The final release of the Flash Player supporting some parts of MPEG-4 standards had become available in Fall 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200708/082107FlashPlayer.html |title=Adobe Press release on MPEG-4 support in Flash Player 9 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>

Adobe Flash Player 10.1 does not support acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice. This makes Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings, as use of headphones for all participants is essential, or at least highly advised.

===Scripting language===
{{See|ActionScript}}

===Proprietary restrictions===
{{See also|Proprietary software}}

The [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] nature of Flash has been a concern to advocates of [[open standard]]s and [[free software]]. Its widespread use has, according to such observers, harmed the otherwise open nature of the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web

|quote= ''Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich-media technologies like Adobe's Flash and Microsoft's Silverlight, the founder of Mozilla Europe has warned.''}}</ref> A response may be seen in [[#Open Screen Project|Adobe's Open Screen Project]]: Adobe's restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications have been lifted.

Representing open standards, inventor of [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and co-author of [[HTML5]], [[Håkon Wium Lie]] explained in a [[AtGoogleTalks|Google tech talk]] entitled "the &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; element" the proposal of [[Theora]] as the format for [[HTML5 video]]:<ref>{{cite web

<blockquote>I believe very strongly, that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if [the video element] is going to succeed. Flash is today the baseline format on the web. The problem with Flash is that it's not an open standard.</blockquote>

===Disclosure===
In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification to the world on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's [[Xara Flare|Flare]] and Sharp's [[Extended Vector Animation]] formats. Several developers quickly created a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[C library|library]] for producing SWF. In February 1999, the company introduced [[MorphInk]] 99, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired [[Middlesoft]] to create a freely available [[development kit|developers' kit]] for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5.

Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a [[non-disclosure agreement]], but they are widely available from various sites.

In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format (Flash 8). Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats (On2, Sorenson Spark, etc.), this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license forbids the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ |title=Adobe File Format Specification FAQ |accessdate=2007-11-15 |publisher=Adobe Systems |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111094129/http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-11}}</ref>

In June 2009, Adobe launched the [[Open Screen Project]] ([http://www.adobe.com/openscreenproject/faq/ Adobe link]), which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as [[Sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], however.<ref>{{cite web| title = Free Flash community reacts to Adobe Open Screen Project | url = http://www.openmedianow.org/?q=node/21 | accessdate = 2008-11-29 }}</ref>

The Adobe Flash Professional multimedia authoring program is used to create content for the [[Adobe Engagement Platform]], such as web applications, games and movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices.

====History====
Adobe Flash Professional is the successor of a software product known as '''FutureSplash Animator''', a [[vector graphics]] and vector animations program released in May 1996. FutureSplash Animator was developed by [[FutureWave Software]], a small software company whose first product, SmartSketch, was a vector-based drawing program for pen-based computers. In 1995, the company decided to add animation capabilities to their product and to create a vector-based animation platform for [[World Wide Web]]; hence FutureSplash Animator was created. Initially, the only way to deploy such animations on the web was through the use of [[Java platform]]; however, the Java platform was later replaced with the [[Netscape]]'s [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture. The FutureSplash animation technology was used on several notable websites such as [[MSN]], the official ''[[The Simpsons]]'' website and ''Disney Daily Blast'' of [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref name="SA-history-official">[http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/events/john_gay/ The History of Flash] by [[Jonathan Gay]]</ref>

In December 1996, [[Macromedia]] bought FutureWave and so re-branded and released FutureSplash Animator as ''Macromedia Flash'' v1.0. In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia; subsequently, in 2007, ''Adobe Flash CS3 Professional'', the next version of Macromedia Flash was released.

===Third-party tools===
[[Open Source]] projects like [[Ajax framework|Ajax Animator]] and the (now defunct) [[UIRA]] aim to create a Flash development environment, complete with a graphical user environment. Alternatively, programs such as [[swfmill]], [[SWFTools]], and [[MTASC]] provide tools to create SWF files, but do so by compiling text, actionscript or XML files into [[Flash animation]]s. It is also possible to create SWF files programmatically using the [[Ming library]], which has interfaces for [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[PHP]], [[C++]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. [[haXe]] is an open source, high-level object-oriented programming language geared towards web-content creation that can compile Flash files.

Many [[shareware]] developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US$50 between 2000 and 2002. In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third-party Flash-creation tool-makers out of the market, allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices, although many of the products still cost less than US$100 and support ActionScript. As for open source tools, [[KToon]] can edit vectors and generate SWF, but its interface is very different from Macromedia's. Another, more recent example of a Flash creation tool is [[SWiSH Max]] made by an ex-employee of Macromedia. [[ToonBoom|Toon Boom]] Technologies also sells a traditional animation tool, based on Flash.

In addition, several programs create [[.swf]]-compliant files as output from their programs. Among the most famous of these are [[Screencast]] tools, which leverage the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content in order to produce demos, tutorials, or software simulations of programs. These programs are typically designed for use by non-programmers, and create Flash content quickly and easily, but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code (i.e. the tweening and transforms, etc.) [[Screencam]] is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format, having been developed since the mid-90s. The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash's presence as a ubiquitous cross-platform animation file format.

Other tools are focused on creating specific types of Flash content. [[Anime Studio]] is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation which creates SWF files. [[Express Animator]] is similarly aimed specifically at animators. [[Question Writer]] publishes its quizzes to Flash file format.

Users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on-line tools that allow them to build full Flash-based websites. One of the oldest services available (1998) is [http://www.flashtogo.com/ FlashToGo]. Such companies provide a wide variety of pre-built models (templates) associated to a Content Management System that empowers users to easily build, edit and publish their websites. Other sites, that allows for greater customization and design flexibility are [[Wix.com]] and [[CirclePad]].

Adobe wrote a software package called [[Adobe LiveMotion]], designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion went through two major releases, but failed to gain any notable user base.

In February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements. In addition, (as of version 2) [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]] presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to SWF.

Flash as a format has become widespread on the desktop market; one estimate is that 95% of PCs have it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://statowl.com/plugin_overview.php |title=Web Browser Plugin Market Share |accessdate=2009-08-18 |publisher=StatOwl}}</ref> while Adobe claims that 98 percent of U.S. web users and 99.3 percent of all Internet desktop users have installed the Flash Player,<ref>98%: [[NPD Group|NPD]] [http://www.macromedia.com/software/player_census/npd/ study]</ref><ref name="Flash Player Statistics">99.3%: Millward Brown survey, conducted June 2009. {{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/ |title=Flash Player Statistics |accessdate=2009-06-04 |author= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Adobe Systems |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref name="turfwar">{{cite journal

The Adobe Flash Player exists for a variety of systems and devices: Windows, [[Mac OS 9]]/[[Mac OS X|X]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[Pocket PC]]/[[Windows CE]], [[OS/2]], [[QNX]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Symbian]], [[Palm OS]], [[BeOS]], and [[IRIX]], although the performance is typically best on Windows (see [[#Performance|Performance]]). For compatibility with devices (embedded systems), see [[Macromedia Flash Lite]].

[[File:Noflash.png|thumb|Some websites rely on Flash so heavily that they are totally unusable without this plugin]]

Among mobile devices, Flash has less penetration because Apple does not bundle or allow third-party runtimes on its iPhone, which accounts for more than 60% of global smartphone web traffic, or the iPod touch, which makes up more than 95% of "mobile Internet device" traffic. This hurts Adobe's ability to market Flash as a ubiquitous mobile platform. However, Flash is enabled on competing mobile platforms, including the version 2.2 [[Android (operating system)|Android]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted on Tuesday, Apr 27, 2010 by Phil Nickinson <!-- --> |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/andy-rubin-says-flash-coming-froyo-version-android-operating-system |title=Andy Rubin says Flash is coming in Froyo version of Android operating system |publisher=Androidcentral.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> while other O.S.s such as Symbian and Palm have versions coming.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Downloading Flash is blocked in countries that are under U.S [[economic sanction|sanctions]] (such as Syria &amp; Sudan). Users in these countries are blocked (by Adobe) from downloading Flash plug-ins for both Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Flash content is usually embedded using the &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; [[html tag]], or the &amp;lt;embed&amp;gt; tag<ref>http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#faq-flash</ref>. Software that does not support either of these tags, and users who cannot or will not install a plugin, will see the replacement text if this is supplied by the web page.

===Accessibility===
Using Flash tends to break conventions associated with normal HTML pages. Selecting text, scrolling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050711.html |title=Scrolling and Scrollbars (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2005-07-11 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> form control and right-clicking act differently than with a regular HTML webpage. Many such interface unexpectancies are fixable by the designer. Usability expert [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled, ''Flash: 99% Bad'' which listed issues like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|date=2000-10-29 |accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> Some problems have been improved upon since Nielsen's complaints:

===Performance===
* Any Flash player has to be able to animate on top of video renderings, which makes [[Hardware acceleration|hardware accelerated]] video rendering at least not as straightforward as with a purpose built [[Media player (application software)|multimedia player]].<ref>[http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2010/01/solving_different_problems.html Solving Different Problems « Penguin.SWF]. Blogs.adobe.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-09.</ref> Therefore, even when only displaying video, Flash players are more resource intensive than dedicated video player software.

===Flash blocking in web browsers===
Some web browsers default to not play Flash content before the user clicks on it, e.g. [[Konqueror]], [[K-Meleon]]. Equivalent "Flash blocker" extensions also exist for many popular browsers: Firefox has [[NoScript]] and [[Flashblock]], and Opera versions since 10.5 feature native Flash blocking. Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content. Internet Explorer has Foxie, which contains a number of features, one of them also named Flashblock. WebKit-based browsers under Mac OS X, such as Apple's Safari, have ClickToFlash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/|title=ClickToFlash|accessdate=2009-10-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Local Shared Objects (“Flash cookies”)===
{{Main|Local Shared Object}}
Like the [[HTTP cookie]], a [[flash cookie]] (also known as a “[[Local Shared Object]]”) can be used to save application data. Flash cookies are not shared across [[Domain name|domains]]. An August 2009 study by the [[Social Science Research Network]] found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing flash cookies, yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them, and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862|title=Soltani, Ashkan, Canty, Shannon, Mayo, Quentin, Thomas, Lauren and Hoofnagle, Chris Jay: Flash Cookies and Privacy|date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Most browsers' cache and history suppress or delete functions do not affect Flash Player's writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache, and the user community is much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html|title=Local Shared Objects -- "Flash Cookies"|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center|date=2005-07-21|accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> Thus, users having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains.

==64-bit support==

Adobe's 64-bit Flash player is available as a preview2 release ("Square"), which was released in September 2010. The "Square" preview is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[MacOS X|Mac]] and [[Linux]].<ref>[http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html Adobe Labs - Downloads: Flash Player "Square" Preview Release]. Labs.adobe.com (2010-09-27).

The key new capabilities in the Flash Player "Square" preview are:
* 64-bit support — Native support for 64-bit operating systems and 64-bit web browsers on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. (Hulu and Amazon which depends on RTMPE are not currently functioning because there are some 64-bit libs that need to be integrated into the branch{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/738761?tstart=0|title=Adobe Forums: Flash Player "Square": 64-bit}})
* Internet Explorer 9 hardware accelerated rendering support — Enhanced support for Internet Explorer 9 Beta. It takes advantage of hardware accelerated graphics in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, utilizing hardware rendering surfaces to improve graphics performance and enable seamless composition.

==Usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
One of the uses of Adobe Flash is to create a '''flash intro''', a piece of animated content displayed at the beginning of a [[website]]. Often, the main content is loading in the background, while the animated content is displayed in the foreground. The intent is to captivate the user's attention so that he or she does not stray from the site, although it may do the opposite as it slows the user from accessing the actual site and can be tedious for users with slow internet connections. Often a "skip" or "skip intro" button is prepared to allow more immediate access to the site's homepage.

==Alternatives to Flash==
===HTML5===
{{main|HTML5 vs. Flash}}

[[HTML 5]] is gaining ground as a competitor to Flash: the [[canvas element]] assists animation, and text can be more easily synchronized with audio and video element timeupdate events. In one example of this, [[Scribd]], a 50 million user a month document sharing website, announced in May 2010 that after three years of investment in Flash, it is changing from that platform to the HTML5 standard.<ref>{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Cade|title=50 million user Scribd scraps Flash for HTML5|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/06/scribd_ditches_flash_for_html5/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Youtube introduced HTML5 support in January 2010<ref>http://www.youtube.com/html5</ref>, and on Jan 11 2011, the [[Google Chromium]] Project announced on their blog that support for closed codecs (particularly H.264) would be removed from future releases of Chrome. The Chromium announcement specifically mentioned that this was an effort to increase the use of license-free HTML5 and the &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; tag, and drive web-wide adoption of the open-source codecs [[VP8]] and [[Theora]].

===Microsoft Silverlight===
In recent years, [[Microsoft Silverlight]] has emerged as a strong competitor to Flash{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. While not yet as prevalent on websites as Flash, Silverlight has been used to provide video streaming for many high profile events, including the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/microsoft-silverlight-gets-a-high-profile-win-2008-bejing-olympics/ |title=Microsoft Silverlight Gets a High Profile Win: 2008 Beijing Olympics| accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wins-the-2010-olympics-for-silverlight-2009-3 |title=Microsoft Wins The 2010 Olympics For Silverlight| accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> and the 2008 conventions for both major political parties in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/aug08/08-19conventions.mspx | title = Microsoft Working to Make Political Conventions Unconventional|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> Silverlight is also used by [[Netflix]] for its instant video streaming service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=288 |title = Netflix Begins Roll-Out of 2nd Generation Media Player for Instant Streaming on Windows PCs and Intel Macs|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>

===Java===
[[Java applet]]s are used both to create interactive visualisations and to present video, three dimensional objects and other media. Java applets are more appropriate for complex visualizations that require significant programming effort in high level language or communications between applet and originating server. Sun's new [[JavaFX]] is considered as another competitor for [[Rich Internet Applications]].

===Other open alternatives===
{{See also|Open format}}

There are equivalent open standards for many simple uses of Flash. Most notably the [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] file formats, the ''canvas'', ''audio'' and ''video'' HTML elements, and the [[JavaScript]] programming language. More complex use cases can be achieved by combining these.

The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]'s [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] standards are seen as the nearest equivalents of Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/09/12/svg.html |title=Picture Perfect |publisher=XML.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmanns.net/flash/AdobeFlash(formerlyMacromediaFlash)W3Cvalidandsearchmachine-friendlydetectingandembedding.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1 |title=xSWF: Flash W3C valid |publisher=Hofmanns.net |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] has supported SVG since version 8 and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] has since version 3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.svg.org/Opera|title=Opera |accessdate=2007-06-18|date=2006-12-27|work=Svg wiki |publisher=Svg.org}}</ref> and [[Mozilla Firefox]]'s built-in support for SVG continues to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svg.org/story/2006/7/13/85643/0175|title=First Firefox 2.0 Beta Released|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last=Quint|first=Antoine|date=2006-07-13|publisher=Svg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG_improvements_in_Firefox_3|title=SVG improvements in Firefox 3 |accessdate=2008-07-20|work=Mozilla Developer Center|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|date=2008-06-17}}</ref> Adobe formerly developed and distributed the 'Adobe SVG Viewer' client plug-in for MS Internet Explorer, but discontinued support and distribution on January 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/svg/eol.html|title=Adobe to Discontinue Adobe SVG Viewer|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]}}</ref> This was in a time when Adobe went from competing with Macromedia's Flash to owning the technology itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webstandards.org/2005/04/19/adobe-rich-internet-applications-and-standards/|title=Adobe, ‘Rich Internet Applications’ and Standards|accessdate=2010-02-25|date=April 19, 2005|publisher=[[Web Standards Project]]}}</ref>

[[UIRA]] was a [[free software]] project that intended to become a complete replacement for Adobe Flash. The project collapsed in mid 2007, though people are now discussing reviving or continuing it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfreeze.net/?page_id=52|title=UIRA, Unfreeze |accessdate=2008-04-21|date=2008-04-20|publisher=unfreeze.net}}</ref> and a few other projects like [http://osflash.org/ajaxanimator Ajax Animator] still exist.

===Third-party players===

Since Flash files do not depend on an open standard such as SVG, this reduces the incentive for non-commercial software to support the format, although there are [[SWF#External links|several]] third party tools which use and generate the SWF file format. <!-- [[IrfanView]] is capable of playing SWF files. - Yes, but this uses the Flash plugin - as is mentioned in the about section of its swf player -->[[Flash Player]] cannot ship as part of a pure [[open source]], or completely free operating system, as its distribution is bound to the [http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/open/licensing/ Macromedia Licensing Program] and subject to approval.

There is, as of late 2008, no complete free software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of Adobe Flash Player.

Presenting the [[free software movement]], [[Richard Stallman]] stated in a speech in October 2004 that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1647626314188526128&amp;ei=LkqgSbfhIYva2gLUotGRDg&amp;hl=un
|title=Richard Stallman on The free software movement and its challenges
|accessdate=2009-02-21
|publisher=Google Video
|location=Australian National University, Canberra, Australia}}</ref>
<blockquote>The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community.</blockquote>

Stallman's argument then was that no [[#Playback|free players]] were comparatively good enough. As of February 2010, [[Gnash]] and [[Swfdec]] have seen limited success in competing with Adobe's player. Many important and popular websites require users to have a Flash player, sometimes with no fallback for non-Flash web users. Therefore, the lack of a good free Flash player is arguably an obstacle to enjoying the web with free software, and the aforementioned ubiquity of Flash makes the problem very evident for anyone who tries. The continual high ranking of Gnash on the Free Software Foundation's list of high priority projects<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html|publisher=Free Software Foundation|title=High Priority Free Software Projects|accessdate=2009-07-09|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> might indicate the severity of the problem, as judged by the free software community.

[[Gnash]] is an active project that aims to create a free player and browser plugin for the Adobe Flash file format and so provide a free alternative to the Adobe Flash Player under the GNU General Public License. Despite potential patent worries because of the proprietary nature of the files involved,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hudson |first=Paul |year=2008 |month=July |title=Quick as a Gnash |journal=Linux Format |issue=107 |pages=48–49 |accessdate=2008-07-20 |quote=What happened is this little thing called "software patents".

[[Swfdec]] is another open-source flash player available for Linux, [[FreeBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]]. See also SWFOpener.

[[Lightspark]] is a new implementation aiming to create a more modern and fast player. Besides hardware-accelerated rendering, it exploits [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] and [[JIT compilation]]. It supports only the new [[ActionScript#ActionScript 3.0|ActionScript 3]] [[Virtual Machine|VM]] introduced in Flash 9.

[[Scaleform]] GFx is a commercial alternative Flash player that features full [[hardware acceleration]] using the [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] and has high conformance with both Flash 10 [[ActionScript 3]]<ref name="ActionScript 3">{{cite web|author=Kris Graft|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30745/New_Scaleform_GFx_40_Supports_ActionScript_3_Flash_10.php|title=Scaleform GFx 4 Supports Flash 10 AS3|accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref> and Flash 8 AS2.

'''Adobe GoLive''' is an [[HTML editor]] and web site management application from [[Adobe Systems]]. It replaced [[Adobe PageMill]] as Adobe's primary HTML editor.  The latest version of Adobe GoLive is version 9, which is not integrated as part of [[Adobe Creative Suite]] 3.  GoLive was discontinued in April 2008.

'''Adobe GoLive''' originated as '''CyberStudio''', the flagship product of a company named '''GoLive Systems, Inc.''' then based in Hamburg, Germany. Adobe purchased GoLive in 1999 and re-branded the '''GoLive CyberStudio''' product to what is now '''Adobe GoLive'''. The first versions of Dreamweaver and Cyberstudio were released in a similar timeframe. However, [[Dreamweaver]] eventually became the dominant HTML editor in both [[marketshare|market]] and [[mindshare]].

Adobe CS2 Premium contains GoLive CS2. While Creative Suite 3 integrates [[Dreamweaver]] as a replacement for GoLive, Adobe released GoLive 9 as a standalone product.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200609/091806CreativeSuite.html Adobe PressRoom]</ref> On April 2008, Adobe announced that sales and development of GoLive had ceased in favor of Dreamweaver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/133181/2008/04/golivedead.html |author=Cohen, Peter |title=Adobe discontinues GoLive |publisher=Macworld |date=27 April 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2008}}</ref>

==General description and distinctive aspects==
GoLive incorporates a largely [[modeless]] workflow that relies heavily on [[drag-and-drop]]. Most user interaction is done via a contextual [[Inspector window|inspector]] rather than the modal workflow found in [[Dreamweaver]]. Among its features are a separate editor for tables that supports nesting, and a two-dimensional panel for applying [[CSS]] styles to elements. GoLive supports [[drag-and-drop]] of native [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]] files via what the company calls "Smart Objects", which then automatically guide the user through saving those files in web-supported formats. Updates to the original Photoshop or Illustrator assets are automatically tracked by GoLive. As a web site management tool, GoLive allows users to transfer and publish content directly from within the application, and allows individual files to be excluded from uploading.

==Language and framework structure==
Adobe GoLive is [[Source code|coded]] in the [[C++]] [[programming language]]<ref>[[Bjarne Stroustrup]]. [http://www.research.att.com/~bs/applications.html C++ applications], 25 May 2007. Retrieved on 19 June 2007.</ref>. It is unusual in that instead of using a standard C++ framework such as [[PowerPlant]] or [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library|MFC]], GoLive uses a custom C++ framework called SCL (Simple Class Library) which was initially built from scratch by the engineers at GoLive Systems Inc. The SCL framework was also used in the short-lived [[Adobe Atmosphere]] 3D software.

==Features==
GoLive has a powerful set of extensibility [[Application programming interface|APIs]] which can be used to add additional functionality to the product. The GoLive [[Software development kit|SDK]] provides interfaces which allow developers to use a combination of [[XML]], [[JavaScript]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] to create plugins for the product.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/golive/ Adobe GoLive SDK]</ref> Unusually, the extensibility API allows developers access to custom drawing and [[event handling]] using JavaScript, as well as a full JavaScript [[debugger]] and [[command line interpreter]]. This allows intermediate-level developers using [[Interpreted language|interpreted]] [[JavaScript]] to create sophisticated [[user interfaces]], the creation of which is normally reserved for developers using [[compiled languages]] such as [[C (programming language)|C]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Adobe Illustrator Artwork''' ('''AI''') is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[file format]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] for representing single-page [[vector graphics|vector-based drawings]] in either the [[Encapsulated_PostScript|EPS]] or [[PDF]] formats.  The '''.ai''' [[filename extension]] is used by [[Adobe Illustrator]].

Early versions of the AI file format are true [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] files with a restricted, compact syntax, with additional semantics represented by Illustrator-specific [[Document Structuring Conventions|DSC comments]] that conform to DSC's Open Structuring Conventions. These files are identical to their corresponding Illustrator EPS counterparts, but with the EPS procsets ([[library (computing)|procedure sets]]) omitted from the file and instead externally referenced using %%Include [[directive]]s.

{{Expert-subject||paragraph (below)|talk=What is the PGF that AI is supposed to be based on?}}
Recent versions of the AI file format, including the PDF-based formats and recent EPS formats, are based on a native format called [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] that is unrelated to both EPS and PDF. PDF compatibility is achieved not by extending the PDF format, but by embedding a complete copy of the native [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] data within the PDF file. The same kind of “dual path” approach is also used when recent versions of Illustrator are saving EPS-compatible files.

==Programs that support AI files==
Aside from Adobe Illustrator, the following applications can edit .ai files:
*[[CorelDRAW]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format with some limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/762365/related/1 |title=CorelDRAW - Supported file formats : Adobe Illustrator (AI) |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name="x3formats">{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/759188/~/coreldraw%E2%AE-graphics-suite-x3-supported-file-formats |title=CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite X3 Supported File Formats |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format.
*[[Ghostscript]] (another GPL-licensed program) can convert AI postscript files into various formats, and also allows programs that use Ghostscript such as [[GIMP]] to import AI files.
*[[Inkscape]] (a free, GPL-licensed program) can import the old Postscript-based Adobe Illustrator format (up to AI ver.8) and AI files based on PDF (AI 9.0 and above).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Current_PDF_Support#Current_Adobe_Illustrator_support |title=Inkscape - Current Adobe Illustrator support |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_formats_can_Inkscape_import.2Fexport.3F |title=Inkscape - What formats can Inkscape import/export?  |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[Skencil]] (another GPL-licensed program) also claims to have some AI support.
*[[sK1 (program)|sK1]] (a free, GPL-licensed vector graphics editor) supports PostScript-based AI files up to AI ver. 9.<ref name="uniconvertor">{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&amp;product=uniconvertor |title=sK1 - UniConvertor - universal vector graphics translator |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[UniConvertor]] (a free, GPL-licensed vector graphics translator) supports PostScript-based AI files up to AI ver. 9.<ref name="uniconvertor" />
*[[Xara Xtreme]] has support for the format that is described as "working". Xara Xtreme for Linux has similar support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xaraxtreme.org/Developers/what-can-xara-xtreme-for-linux-do-now.html  |title=What can Xara Xtreme for Linux do now? |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[XnView]], a freeware graphics format converter, claims to be able to read AI file formats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xnview.com/en/formats.html |title=XnView  - supported formats |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>, if the AI file was saved with the PDF compatibility option.

GhostScript! |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[FlexiSign]] (Vector Program used in Signmaking) Can read AI files.
*[[EnRoute]] (Vector program for routers) Can read AI files.
Viewers:
* [[Adobe Reader]] can open .ai files for viewing if they are saved with the PDF compatibility option

'''Adobe Persuasion''' (formerly '''Aldus Persuasion''') was a [[presentation program]] developed for the [[Macintosh]] [[platform (computing)|platform]] by [[Aldus Corporation]].  After it was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] in 1994, when the two companies merged, a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released.  Adobe discontinued production from September 1997.

A key feature of Persuasion, which distinguished it from [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] at the time, was the use of an outline to represent the text content of the slides, which was immediately reflected on the slides (and vice versa). PowerPoint eventually copied this feature.

== Versions history==
* Aldus Persuasion 1.0. Made for Macintosh only.  Created by [[Peter Polash]].
* Aldus Persuasion 2.0. Made Macintosh and IBM was available in 1991. 
* Aldus Persuasion 2.x
* Adobe Persuasion 3.0. Had both Mac and Windows versions, and was released in 1995.  It was bundled with the Persuasion Player.
* Adobe Persuasion 4.0. Was released in 1996.  The Mac and Windows versions shipped together, with a simultaneous end-user license for each platform.  It was bundled with [[Adobe Acrobat Distiller]] 3.0, [[Acrobat Reader]] 3.0, Persuasion Player, [[Adobe Type Manager]], and a collection of clip art, movies, sounds, and 20 fonts.  It included a utility to directly convert [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] files.

'''Adobe Photoshop''' is a [[Graphics software|graphics editing program]] developed and published by [[Adobe Systems Incorporated]].

Adobe's 2003 "[[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]]" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe Photoshop CS. Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS5 is the [[Adobe Photoshop release history|12th major release]] of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price. Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: '''Adobe Photoshop''', and '''Adobe Photoshop Extended''', with the Extended having extra features available. Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard, which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition. 

Alongside Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Extended, Adobe also publishes [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]] and [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]], collectively called "The Adobe Photoshop Family" by Adobe. In 2008, Adobe released [[Adobe Photoshop Express]], a free [[Web application|web-based]] image editing tool to edit photos directly on blogs and social networking sites.

{{further|[[Adobe Photoshop release history]]}}

=== Early history ===
In 1987, [[Thomas Knoll]], a PhD student at the [[University of Michigan]], began writing a program on his [[Macintosh Plus]] to display [[grayscale]] images on a monochrome display. This program, called Display, caught the attention of his brother [[John Knoll]], an [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] employee, who recommended Thomas turn it into a fully-fledged image editing program. Thomas took a six month break from his studies in 1988 to collaborate with his brother on the program, which had been renamed ImagePro.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.photoshopnews.com/feature-stories/photoshop-profile-thomas-john-knoll-10/ |title=Thomas &amp; John Knoll |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Schewe, Jeff |year=2000 |work=PhotoshopNews }}</ref> Later that year, Thomas renamed his program Photoshop and worked out a short-term deal with scanner manufacturer Barneyscan to distribute copies of the program with a slide scanner; a "total of about 200 copies of Photoshop were shipped" this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html |title=From Darkroom to Desktop&amp;mdash;How Photoshop Came to Light |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Story, Derrick |date=2000-02-18 |work=Story Photography }}</ref>

During this time, John traveled to [[Silicon Valley]] and gave a demonstration of the program to engineers at [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Russell Brown, art director at [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]. Both showings were successful, and Adobe decided to purchase the license to distribute in September 1988.<ref name="history"/> While John worked on [[Plugin|plug-in]]s in California, Thomas remained in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] writing program code. ''Photoshop'' 1.0 was released in 1990 for Macintosh exclusively<!--, and could fit on a single 1.44 MB [[floppy disk]]-->.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011051727/http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10  |archivedate=2007-10-11  |title=How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Hormby, John |date=2007-06-05 |work=Story Photography }}</ref>

== Features ==
{{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors#Features}}

Photoshop has ties with other Adobe software for media editing, animation, and authoring.  The '''.PSD''' (Photoshop Document), Photoshop's native format, stores an image with support for most imaging options available in Photoshop.  These include layers with [[image mask|masks]], [[color spaces]], [[ICC profile]]s, transparency, text, [[alpha channels]] and [[spot color]]s, [[clipping path]]s, and [[duotone]] settings.  This is in contrast to many other file formats (e.g. .EPS or .GIF) that restrict content to provide streamlined, predictable functionality.

Photoshop's popularity means that the .PSD format is widely used, and it is supported to some extent by most competing software.  The .PSD file format can be exported to and from [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]], to make professional standard DVDs and provide non-linear editing and special effects services, such as backgrounds, textures, and so on, for television, film, and the Web. Photoshop is a [[raster graphic|pixel-based]] image editor, unlike programs such as [[Macromedia FreeHand]] (now defunct), [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Inkscape]] or [[CorelDraw]], which are [[vector graphics|vector-based]] image editors.

Photoshop uses color models [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Lab color model|lab]], [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], [[grayscale]], binary [[bitmap]], and [[duotone]]. Photoshop has the ability to read and write [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] image formats such as [[Encapsulated PostScript|.EPS]], [[Portable Network Graphics|.PNG]], [[GIF|.GIF]], [[JPEG|.JPEG]], and [[Adobe Fireworks]].

=== CS3 ===
[[Image:Photoshop CS3 Smart Layers.png|frame|right|Smart Layers display the filter without altering the original image (here on Mac OS X)]]

New productivity features include a streamlined interface, improved Camera RAW support, better control over print options, enhanced [[PDF]] support, and better management with [[Adobe Bridge]]. Editing tools new to CS3 are the Clone Source palette and nondestructive Smart Filters, and other features such as the brightness and contrast adjustment and Vanishing Point module were enhanced.  The Black and White adjustment option improves control over manual grayscale conversions with a dialog box similar to that of Channel Mixer. Compositing is assisted with Photoshop's new Quick Selection and Refine Edge tools and improved [[image stitching]] technology.<ref name="features">{{cite web |url=http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop_overview.pdf |title=Adobe Photoshop CS3 Product overview |accessdate=2007-06-17  |year=2007 |work=Adobe official site |format=PDF }}</ref>

CS3 Extended contains all features of CS3 plus tools for editing and importing some [[List of file formats#3D graphics|3D graphics file formats]], enhancing video, and comprehensive image analysis tools, utilizing [[MATLAB]] integration and [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine|DICOM]] file support.<ref>{{cite web | title = Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended - Product overview | accessdate = 2007-06-17  | year = 2007 | url =

=== CS4 ===

===CS5===
Photoshop CS5 was launched on April 12, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cs5launch.adobe.com/ | title=Adobe Creative Suite 5 Launch | publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated | accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> In a video posted on its official [[Facebook]] page, the development team revealed the new technologies under development, including three dimensional brushes and warping tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/video |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

A version of Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended was used for a Prerelease Beta. A large group of selected Photoshop users were invited to beta test in mid-February 2010.

==Version history==
{{main|Adobe Photoshop release history}}

==Language availabilities==
Photoshop is available in the following languages:

Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian.<ref name="PhotoshopLanguages">{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/languages/ |title=language versions &#124; Adobe Photoshop CS5 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

The Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew versions are available from Winsoft.<ref name="PhotoshopLanguages"/>

==Plugins==
{{Main|Photoshop plugin}}

Photoshop functionality can be extended by add-on programs called [[Photoshop plugin]]s which act like mini-editors that modify the image. The most common type are filter plugins that provide various image effects. They are located in the 'Filter' menu. Photoshop plugin API has become a standard, and many other image editors also support Photoshop Plugins.

Adobe Camera Raw (also known as ACR and Camera Raw) is a special plugin, supplied free by Adobe, used primarily to read and process [[Raw image format|raw image files]] so that the resultant images can be processed by Photoshop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html |title=Digital camera raw file support |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> It is invoked by attempting to open such a file, rather than from the 'Filter' menu, but like other plugins is listed in the 'Help &amp;gt; About Plug-In' menu (as "Camera Raw"). It can also be opened via the [[Adobe Bridge]] by clicking on any image and selecting 'File &amp;gt; Open in Adobe Camera Raw'.

== Cultural impact ==
''Photoshop'' and derivatives such as ''Photoshopped,'' ''Shopped,'' and ''Shooped'' have become verbs that are sometimes used to refer to images edited by Photoshop,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/2000/08/bc/28photoshop/|title=Photoshop through the Years|author=Macworld Staff}}</ref> or any image manipulating program. "Photoshop" is also used as a noun to refer to image editing programs [[Genericized trademark|in general]]. Such derivatives are discouraged by Adobe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html#section-4|title=PROPER USE OF THE PHOTOSHOP TRADEMARK}}</ref>

'''Adobe Photoshop Elements''' is the consumer version of the [[Adobe Photoshop]] [[raster image]] editing product, targeted at hobbyist users and hence sold at a fraction (roughly 1/6th) of the cost of the professional product. It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer and simpler options. The program allows users to create, edit, organize and share images, all from the same product.

Originally introduced alongside Photoshop version 7, Photoshop Elements targets photography enthusiasts and thus lacks many features that make it useful in a proper print production environment. For example, Photoshop Elements cannot export files in the [[CMYK]] color mode (without using a third-party plug-in), supports a simplified color management system, and excludes detailed soft-proofing. It also either eliminates completely or offers simplified versions of some of the more powerful plug-ins, and instead has a number of features aimed at non-experts (such as removing the [[red-eye effect]] or changing the skin tone in a picture). An example of a redesigned feature would be the Variations correction dialog. Some versions can, however, open, edit, and save [[PDF]]s.

Photoshop LE (Limited Edition) was Adobe's consumer raster image editing product prior to the introduction of Elements. Photoshop LE had similar limitations to ''Elements''.

Adobe has also released a new free image editing web application, [[Adobe Photoshop Express]], with many more limitations than Adobe Photoshop Elements.

<title>Advance parole</title>
<text>{{Orphan|date=December 2010}}
{{globalize|date=December 2010}}

'''Advance parole''' is an immigration document issued by the United States. It is not a re-entry permit; it is only issued to aliens without [[permanent residency]]. Advance Parole is permission for certain aliens, who do not have a valid immigrant [[Visa (document)|visa]], to re-enter the United States after traveling abroad. Such aliens include those who have applied to adjust their status to that of permanent resident or to change non-immigrant status. Advance parole must be approved before the applicant leaves the United States, or any residency application will in general be denied. Travel outside of the United States may have severe consequences for aliens who have been unlawfully present even if they have obtained advance parole.

==Who needs Advance Parole?==
Aliens in the United States who have:
*an application for adjustment of status pending.
*been admitted as a [[refugee]] or have been granted asylum.
*been granted benefits under the Family Unity Program.
*been granted Temporary Protected Status.
*an asylum application pending.
*an emergent personal or bona fide reason to travel temporarily abroad.

Note: Aliens holding valid H-1 (temporary worker in a specialty occupation) or L-1 (intra-company transferee) visas and their dependants in H-4 or L-2 status who have filed for adjustment of status do not have to file for advance parole as long as they maintain their non-immigrant status.

==Who is not eligible for Advance Parole?==
Aliens in the United States are not eligible for Advance Parole if they are:
*in the United States without a valid immigration status.
*an exchange alien subject to the foreign residence requirement.
*the beneficiary of a private bill.
*under removal proceedings.

==How does one obtain advance parole?==
To obtain advance parole, file USCIS Form I-131 (Application for Travel Document), complete with supporting documentation, photos and fee, at your local [[USCIS]] office or the Service Center having jurisdiction over your place of residence. After receiving USCIS Form I-131, read it carefully and note the documentation and photos that must be submitted. Detailed information is provided in the instructions. Further information on forms, filing fees, and fee waivers is available in Forms, Fees &amp; Filing Locations.

==Does Advance Parole guarantee admission into the United States?==
Advance parole does not guarantee admission into the United States. Aliens who have obtained advance parole are still subject to the USCIS inspection process at the port of entry.

<title>Advanced Computing Environment</title>
<text>The '''Advanced Computing Environment''' ('''ACE''') was defined by an industry consortium in the early 1990s to be the next generation commodity computing platform, the successor to [[personal computer]]s based on [[Intel]]'s [[x86|32-bit instruction set architecture]]. The effort found little support in the market and dissolved due to a lack of sales and infighting within the group.

== Formation  ==
The consortium was announced on April 9, 1991 by [[Compaq]], [[Microsoft]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]].<ref>{{cite news

Other members of the consortium included [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[Kubota]], [[NEC Corporation]], [[JFE Group|NKK]], [[Olivetti]], [[Prime Computer]], [[Pyramid Technology]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sony]], [[Sumitomo]], [[Tandem Computers]], [[Wang Laboratories]], and [[Zenith Data Systems]]. Besides these large companies, several [[start-up companies]] built ACE-compliant systems as well. 

The environment standardized on the [[MIPS architecture]] and two [[operating system]]s: [[SCO UNIX]] with [[Open Desktop]] and what would become [[Windows NT]] (originally named OS/2 3.0). The [[Advanced RISC Computing]] (ARC) document was produced to give hardware and firmware specifications for the platform. 

The porting of the Microsoft operating system to other [[instruction set architectures]] created hope that other hardware platforms could more effectively compete with [[Wintel]] [[Personal computer|PC]]s . The belief was that [[RISC]]-based computers would deliver superior price-performance to that of the older platform. Eventually, Windows NT was also ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] and [[PowerPC]] architectures as well. 

The initiative was used by microprocessor companies as an attempt to take market share away from Intel. System companies used the initiative as an attempt to take market share away from the [[workstation]] leader, [[Sun Microsystems]].

==The "Apache Group"==
Soon after the initiative was announced, a dissenting faction of seven ACE members declared that the decision to support only little-[[endian]] architectures was short-sighted.  This subgroup, known as the '''Apache Group''', promoted a big-endian alternative. The group, whose name was conceived as a pun on "Big Indian", was unrelated to the later [[Apache Software Foundation]].  It later adopted the name ''MIPS/Open''. A rift within the ACE consortium was averted when it was decided to add support for big-endian [[SVR4]].<ref>{{cite news

 }}</ref>

==Dissolution==
Even so, the ACE initiative (and consortium) began to fall apart little more than a year after it started, as it became apparent that there was not a mass market for an alternative to the [[Wintel]] computing platform. The upstart platforms did not offer enough performance improvement from the incumbent PC and there were major cost disadvantages of such systems due to the low volume production. When the initiative started, RISC based systems (running at 100-200 MHz at the time) had substantial performance advantage over [[Intel 80486]] and original [[Intel P5|Pentium]] chips (running at approximately 60 MHz at the time).{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} Intel quickly migrated the Pentium design to newer [[semiconductor]] process generations and that performance (and operating frequency) advantage slipped away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Compaq was the first company to leave the consortium, stating that with the departure of CEO [[Rod Canion]], one of the primary backers behind the formation of ACE, they were shifting priorities away from higher-end systems.<ref>{{cite news

 | accessdate = 2007-05-03
 }}</ref>  This was followed in short order by SCO announcing that they were suspending all work on moving their version of Unix to the MIPS platform.

There were other potential conflicts: earlier that year, MIPS had been purchased by SGI, which may have also contributed to concerns about the neutrality of the target platform. DEC had released their Alpha processor and were less interested in promoting a competing architecture.  And finally, the significant improvements in Intel [[x86]] performance made abandoning it less attractive, and although ACE supported x86 for a time, Intel was never a member.

<title>Advanced Load Address Table</title>
<text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}
The '''Advanced Load Address Table''' (ALAT) is a functional unit in the Intel [[Itanium]] processor architecture. It is implemented with an [[associative memory]]. The '''ALAT''' is used to store information related to advance load instructions, as part of the [[speculative execution]] process.

An Advanced Load is a method aimed in reducing the latency of costly load operations. If there is a possibility that a data item will be required, the program may specify its advanced load, even before the confirmation that the item will be needed.

In the [[Itanium]] architecture, this advanced load order may be issued by an ''ld.a'' instruction. This instruction allocates an entry in the '''Advanced Load Address Table''' and starts the data transfer. The '''ALAT''' is used to identify the address from where the data will be read, the length of the required data block, the destination register and the state of the load operation. The success of the advanced load may then be checked with a ''ld.c'' or ''chk.a'' instruction that looks for the related information in the '''ALAT'''.

The '''ALAT''' in the original ''Itanium'' processor was implemented by a 2-way [[set-associative]] memory with 32 entries. In the ''Itanium 2'', this unit was changed to a 32 entries [[fully associative]] structure. This design required extra hardware elements (longer memory tags, and more tag [[digital comparator|comparators]]) but it improved performance of speculative programs since [[cache miss]] due to mapping conflicts is avoided.

-->
: ''not to be confused with [[Advanced RISC Machines]]''

'''Advanced RISC Computing''' ('''ARC''') is a specification promulgated by a defunct consortium of [[computer]] manufacturers (the [[Advanced Computing Environment]] project), setting forth a standard [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] [[RISC]]-based computer [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[firmware]] environment.

Although ACE went defunct, and no computer was ever manufactured which fully complied with the ARC standard, the ARC system still exerts a widespread legacy in that all [[Microsoft]] [[Windows NT]]-based [[operating systems]] (such as [[Windows XP]]) used ARC conventions for naming [[Booting|boot]] devices before [[Windows Vista]].

Further, [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] uses a modified version of the ARC firmware (which it calls [[ARCS (computing)|ARCS]]) in its systems. All SGI computers which run [[IRIX]] 6.1 or later (such as the [[SGI Indy|Indy]], [[SGI Octane|Octane]], ''etc.'') boot from an ARCS console (which uses the same drive naming conventions as Windows, accordingly).

In addition, most of the various RISC-based computers designed to run Windows NT used versions of the ARC boot console to boot NT. Among these computers were:

* MIPS R4000-based systems such as the [[MIPS Magnum]] workstation
* all [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]]-based machines with a [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus designed prior to the end of support for Windows NT Alpha in September 1999 (the Alpha ARC firmware was also known as AlphaBIOS)
* most Windows NT-capable [[PowerPC]] computers (such as the IBM [[RS/6000]] 40P).

It was also predicted that [[Intel]] [[IA-32]]-based computers would adopt the ARC console, although only SGI ever marketed such IA-32-based machines with ARC firmware (namely, the [[SGI Visual Workstation]] series, which went on sale in 1999).

Products complying (to some degree) with the ARC standard include:

<title>Advanced Tactical Center</title>
<text>{{Orphan|date=May 2009}}<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Atc scct.jpg|thumb|right|ATC for ''Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory'']] -->
The '''Advanced Tactical Center''' (ATC) is a series software tools used in [[Military tactics|tactics-oriented]] [[computer games]]. The ATCs are developed and maintained by [[Foolish Entertainment]].

==Concept==
The ATC allows the creation of [[online]] sessions, during which players can discuss the tactics they wish to apply for the upcoming matches.<ref>[http://www.gamershell.com/download_9801.shtml Gamershell.com, ATC's description and download]</ref> After loading the supplied map of the area the user is given a variety of sketching tools, such as pencils, text editors and game related icons, in order to create a graphical representation of his strategy. During the course of the drawing the other users are updated live on the course of the map's development. The software allows saving and loading the sketches to and from the files, stored on the local [[Hard disk drive|HDD]].

The aim behind the creation of the software kit is to give the players an easy and efficient way to share and visualise tactical data.

==Supported Applications==

<title>Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced stub|date=December 2009}}
[[Image:ATLAS Enclosure.png|right|thumb|ATLAS enclosure for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] attractions]]

The '''Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator''', or '''ATLAS''', is a large [[hydraulic]] [[motion simulator]]. It was designed, as the name implies, for the theme park industry. The ATLAS is a product of Rediffusion Simulation in [[Sussex]], [[England]], now owned by [[Thomson-CSF]].

The ATLAS was derived from military flight simulation technology. It uses six hydraulic actuators to provide a broad range of movement.

In the later half of the 1980s, Disney used this technology for two amusement rides, [[Star Tours]] at [[Disneyland]] (and later [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]]), and [[Body Wars]] at [[EPCOT Center]]. The Disney attractions feature large, 40-person cabins hidden from outside view, arranged lengthwise with four or six simulators per installation. There are four simulators at Disneyland's Star Tours and EPCOT's Body Wars, while the remaining Star Tours installations have six. Body Wars is now defunct and planned for removal with the closure of the [[Wonders of Life]] pavilion.

<title>Advanced process control</title>
<text>In [[control theory]] '''Advanced process control''' (APC) is a broad term composed of different kinds of [[process control]] tools, often used for solving multivariable control problems or discrete control problem. Advanced control describes a practice which draws elements from many disciplines ranging from control engineering, signal processing, statistics, decision theory and artificial intelligence

== Overview ==
Advanced process control is composed of different kinds of [[process control]] tools, for example:
* [[Model predictive control]] (MPC),  
* [[Statistical process control]] (SPC), 
* Run2Run (R2R), 
* Fault detection and classification (FDC), 
* [[sensor|Sensor control]] and 
* [[feedback|Feedback systems]]. 
APC applications are often used for solving multivariable control or discrete control problems.

Normally an APC system is connected to a [[distributed control system]] (DCS). The APC application will calculate moves that are sent to regulatory controllers. Historically the interfaces between DCS and APC systems were dedicated software interfaces. Nowadays the communication protocol between these system is managed via the industry standard [[OLE for process control]] (OPC) protocol.

== Advanced process control: Topics ==
=== APC industries ===
*APC can be found in the (petro)chemical industries where it makes it possible to control multivariable control problems. Since these controllers contain the dynamic relationships between variables it can predict in the future how variables will behave. Based on these predictions, actions can be taken now to maintain variables within their limits. APC is used when the models can be estimated and do not vary too much.

*In the complex [[semiconductor industry]] where several hundred steps with multiple re-entrant possibilities occurs, APC plays an important role for control the overall production.

APC is more and more used in other industries. In the mining industry for example, successful applications of APC (often combine to Fuzzy Logic) have been successfully implemented. In the mining industry, the models change and APC implementation is more complex.

=== Terminology ===
Manipulated Variables (MVs) are variables where advanced controllers send setpoints to. Controlled variables (CVs) are variables that normally need to be controlled between limits. Disturbance variables (DVs) are only used as an input to the controller, they cannot be influenced, but when measured contribute to the predictability of the CV.

<title>Adversary model</title>
<text>In [[computer science]], an [[online algorithm]] measures its [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitiveness]] against different '''adversary models'''. For deterministic algorithms, the adversary is the same, the adaptive offline adversary. For randomized online algorithms competitiveness can depend upon the adversary model used.

==Common adversaries==

The three common adversaries are the oblivious adversary, the adaptive online adversary, and the adaptive offline adversary.

The '''oblivious adversary''' is sometimes referred to as the weak adversary. This adversary knows the algorithm's code, but does not get to know the randomized results of the algorithm.

The '''adaptive online adversary''' is sometimes called the medium adversary. This adversary must make its own decision before it is allowed to know the decision of the algorithm. 

The '''adaptive offline adversary''' is sometimes called the strong adversary. This adversary knows everything, even the random number generator. This adversary is so strong that randomization does not help against him.

==Important results==
From S. Ben-David, A. Borodin, [[Richard Karp|R. Karp]], G. Tardos, A. Wigderson we have:
* If there is a randomized algorithm that is α-competitive against any adaptive offline adversary then there also exists an α-competitive deterministic algorithm.
* If G is a c-competitive randomized algorithm against any adaptive online adversary, and there is a randomized d-competitive algorithm against any oblivious adversary, then G is a randomized (c * d)-competitive algorithm against any adaptive offline adversary.

<title>Aerial video</title>
<text>[[File:Aerial-dennisLG.jpg|thumb|alt=USGS aerial photography crew gathers data following the landfall of a hurricane.|USGS aerial photography crew gathers data following the landfall of a hurricane.]]

[[File:Aerial-videoLG.jpg|thumb|alt=Digital video and recording system used aboard aircraft during coastal oblique video and photography missions.|Digital video and recording system used aboard aircraft during coastal oblique video and photography missions.]]

'''Aerial video''' is an emerging form of [[data acquisition]] for scene understanding and object tracking. The video is captured by low flying aerial platforms that integrate global positioning systems ([[GPS]]) and automated [[image processing]] to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction. Recorders can incorporate in-flight voice records from the cockpit intercom system. The addition of audio narration is an extremely valuable tool for documentation and communication.  Global positioning system ([[GPS]]) data is incorporated with a text-captioning device on each video frame. Helicopter platforms enable ‘low and slow’ flights, acquiring a continuous visual record without motion blur.

Innovations in [[remote sensing]] cameras have allowed the identification of objects that could not have been previously identified. Pipeline and power corridors and their infrastructure can be documented with [[digital media]] recording. Video Mapping System is an example of how this technology is used today.

Since the 1980s, aerial videography has seen increased use in applications where its advantages over traditional photography (lower cost and immediate availability of data) outweigh its disadvantages (poorer [[spatial resolution]] and difficulty of analysis due to lack of [[stereo imaging]]) (Mausel et al. 1992; Meisner 1986). King (1995) provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of video sensors and their applications, many of which focused on

1.The measurement of transient phenomena such as wildlife populations (Sidle and Ziewits 1990; Strong  and Cowardin 1995) and pest infestations (Everitt et al. 1994);<br />
2. Mapping of dynamic land features such as wetland plant communities (Jennings et al. 1992) and coastal <br /> landforms(Eleveld et al. 2000);<br />
3.Land cover mapping in remote areas with limited existing aerial photography and poor infrastructure <br />(Marshet al. 1994; Slaymaker and Hannah 1997).

<title>Affinity mask</title>
<text>{{Context|date=October 2009}}

An '''affinity mask''' is a [[mask (computing)|bit mask]] indicating what [[Central processing unit|processor(s)]] a [[thread (computer science)|thread]] or [[process (computing)|process]] should be run on by the [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] of an [[operating system]]. Setting the affinity mask for certain processes running under Windows can be useful as there are several system processes (especially on domain controllers) that are restricted to the first CPU / Core. So, excluding the first CPU might lead to better application performance.

== Windows API ==
Thread affinity in [[Microsoft Windows]] can be specified with the ''SetThreadAffinityMask'' function. Forcing of each [[OpenMP]] thread to distinctive cores in Windows can be accomplished by means of the following [[C (programming language)|C]] code:
<source lang="c">
 #include &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;
 #include &amp;lt;omp.h&amp;gt;
 // Set OpenMP thread affinity
 void set_thread_affinity () {
     #pragma omp parallel default(shared)
     {
     DWORD_PTR mask = (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; omp_get_thread_num());
     SetThreadAffinityMask( GetCurrentThread(), mask );
     }
 }
</source>

<title>Affix grammar</title>
<text>{{Noref|date=February 2009}}
An '''affix grammar''' is a kind of [[formal grammar]]; it is used to describe the [[syntax]] of languages, mainly [[computer language]]s, using an approach based on how natural language is typically described.

The grammatical rules of an affix grammar are those of a [[context-free grammar]], except that certain parts in the nonterminals (the [[affix]]es) are used as arguments.  If the same affix occurs multiple times in a rule, its value must [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]], i.e. it must be the same everywhere.  In some types of affix grammar, more complex relationships between affix values are possible. 

== Example ==

We can describe an extremely simple fragment of English in the following manner:

<code>
  ''Sentence'' &amp;rarr; ''Subject'' ''Predicate''
  ''Subject'' &amp;rarr; ''Noun''
  ''Predicate'' &amp;rarr; ''Verb'' ''Object''
  ''Object'' &amp;rarr; ''Noun''
 
  ''Noun'' &amp;rarr; John
  ''Noun'' &amp;rarr; Mary
  ''Noun'' &amp;rarr; children
  ''Noun'' &amp;rarr; parents
 
  ''Verb'' &amp;rarr; like
  ''Verb'' &amp;rarr; likes
  ''Verb'' &amp;rarr; help
  ''Verb'' &amp;rarr; helps
</code>

This [[context-free grammar]] describes simple sentences such as

<code>
  John likes children
  Mary helps John
  children help parents
  parents like John
</code>

With more nouns and verbs, and more rules to introduce other parts of speech, a large range of English sentences can be described; so this is a promising approach for describing the syntax of English.

However, the given grammar also describes sentences such as

<code>
  John like children
  children helps parents
</code>

These sentences are wrong: in English, subject and verb have a [[grammatical number]], which must agree.

An affix grammar can express this directly:
<code>
  ''Sentence &amp;rarr; Subject+number Predicate+number''
  ''Subject+number &amp;rarr; Noun+number''
  ''Predicate+number &amp;rarr; Verb+number Object''
  ''Object &amp;rarr; Noun+number''
 
  ''Noun+''singular &amp;rarr; John
  ''Noun+''singular &amp;rarr; Mary
  ''Noun+''plural &amp;rarr; children

This grammar only describes correct English sentences, although it could be argued that
<code>
  John likes John
</code>
is still incorrect and should instead read
<code>
  John likes himself
</code>

This, too, can be incorporated using affixes, if the means of describing the relationships between different affix values are powerful enough. As remarked above, these means depend on the type of affix grammar chosen.

== Types of affix grammars ==

In the simplest type of affix grammar, affixes can only take values from a finite domain, and affix values can only be related through agreement, as in the example.
Applied in this way, affixes increase compactness of grammars, but do not add expressive power.

Another approach is to allow affixes to take arbitrary strings as values and allow   concatenations of affixes to be used in rules.  The ranges of allowable values for affixes can be described with context-free grammar rules.  This produces the formalism of ''two-level grammars'', also known as ''[[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s'' or ''2VW'' grammars.  These have been successfully used to describe complicated languages, in particular, the syntax of the [[Algol 68]] [[programming language]].  However, it turns out that, even though affix values can only be manipulated with string concatenation, this formalism is [[Turing complete]]; hence, even the most basic questions about the language described by an arbitrary 2VW grammar are [[Undecidable language|undecidable]] in general.

[[Extended Affix Grammar]]s, developed in the 1980s, are a more restricted version of the same idea.  They were mainly applied to describe the grammar of natural language, e.g. English.

Another possibility is to allow the values of affixes to be computed by code written in some programming language.  Two basic approaches have been used:
* In [[attribute grammar]]s, the affixes (called attributes) can take values from arbitrary domains (e.g. integer or real numbers, complex data structures) and arbitrary functions can be specified, written in a language of choice, to describe how affix values in rules are derived from each other.
* In CDL (the [[Compiler Description Language]]) and its successor [[CDL2]], developed in the 1970s, fragments of source code (usually in [[assembly language]]) can be used in rules instead of normal right-hand sides, allowing primitives for input scanning and affix value computations to be expressed directly.  Designed as a basis for practical [[compiler]] construction, this approach was used to write compilers, and other software, e.g. a [[text editor]].

<title>Ageometresia</title>
<text>'''Ageometresia''', a term purely [[Greek language|Greek]], ''Αγεωμετρησια'', has been used by [[English language|English]] writers to denote a want or defect in [[geometry]]. [[Johannes Kepler]], having no direct and geometrical method of finding certain matters in his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|elliptical theory]], namely how to calculate the [[true anomaly]] from the [[mean anomaly]], has been charged by others with ageometresia. The term was coined in the late 18th century by the [[India]]n mathematician Yousaf Shah.

<title>Aggregate function</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=November 2009}}

In [[computer science]], an '''aggregate function''' is a [[subroutine|function]] that returns a single  value from a collection of input values such as a [[set (computer science)|set]], a [[set (computer science)#Multiset|bag]] or a [[list (computing)|list]].

Common aggregate functions include:

* [[Average]]()
* [[Counting|Count]]()
* [[Maximum]]()
* [[Median]]()
* [[Minimum]]()
* [[Mode (statistics)|Mode]]()
* [[Sum]]()

Aggregate functions are common in numerous [[programming languages]] such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], in [[spreadsheet]]s, and in [[relational algebra]].

==SQL Aggregate Functions==
SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column.

Useful aggregate functions:

    * AVG() - Returns the average value
    * COUNT() - Returns the number of rows
    * FIRST() - Returns the first value
    * LAST() - Returns the last value
    * MAX() - Returns the largest value
    * MIN() - Returns the smallest value
    * SUM() - Returns the sum

<title>Agitator (device)</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced stub|date=December 2009}}
{{Lead too short|date=March 2010}}
An '''agitator''' is a [[device]] or [[mechanism]] to put something into [[Motion (physics)|motion]] by [[wikt:shaking|shaking]] or [[wikt:stirring|stirring]].

==Manual agitator==
* A [[Rock (geology)|rock]] can be a device used to agitate dirt and other solids from fabric in washing
* [[Dishwasher#Manual dishwashers|Manual dishwashers]]
* A [[stirring rod]]

==Washing machine agitator==
[[Image:Washing machine agitator.JPG|thumb|Agitator for a laundromat washing machine.]]
In a top load [[washing machine]] the agitator projects from the bottom of the wash basket and creates the wash action by rotating back and forth, rolling garments from the top of the load, down to the bottom, then back up again and due to that it seems so.

There are several types of agitators with the most common  are the "straight-vane" and "dual-action." The "straight-vane" is a one-part agitator with bottom and side fins that usually turns back and forth. The Dual-action is a two-part agitator that has bottom washer fins that moves back and forth and a spiral top that rotates clockwise to help guide the clothes to the bottom washer fins.

The modern agitator, which is the dual action, was first made in [[Kenmore]] washing machines in the 1980s to present. These agitators are known by [[Kenmore]] as dual-rollover and triple-rollover action agitators.

==Magnetic agitator==
This is a device formed by a little metallic bar (called the agitation bar) which is normally covered by a plastic layer, and by a sheet that has underneath it a rotatory magnet or a series of electromagnets arranged in a circular form to create a magnetic rotatory field. It is very common that the sheet has an arrangement of electric resistances that can heat some chemical solutions. 

Thus, during the operation of a typical magnetic agitator, the magnetic agitator bar is moved inside a container that can be a flask or a glass with some liquid inside that can be agitated. The container must be placed on the sheet, so that the magnetic field influences the agitation bar and makes it rotate. This allows it to mix different substances at high speeds.

Shihab al-Din abu 'l-Abbas Ahmad ben Ali ben '''Ahmad Abd Allah al-Qalqashandi''' (1355 or 1356 &amp;ndash; 1418) was a medieval [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writer and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] born in a village in the [[Nile Delta]]. He is the author of ''Subh al-a 'sha'', a fourteen volume [[encyclopedia]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which included a section on [[cryptology]]. This information was attributed to Taj ad-Din Ali ibn ad-Duraihim ben Muhammad ath-Tha 'alibi al-Mausili who lived from 1312 to 1361, but whose writings on cryptology have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both [[Substitution cipher|substitution]] and [[Transposition cipher|transposition]], and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each [[plaintext]] letter. Also traced to Ibn al-Duraihim is an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of tables of [[letter frequencies]] and sets of letters which can not occur together in one word.

'''Ahmed Hassan Zewail''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد حسن زويل}}) (born February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]], [[Egypt]]) is an [[Egypt]]ian-[[United States|American]] scientist, and the winner of the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]. He is the Linus Pauling Chair Professor Chemistry and Professor of Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

== Birth and education ==
Ahmad Zewail was born on February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]] and raised in [[Disuq]]. He received bachelor's degree and MS degree from the [[University of Alexandria]] before moving from [[Egypt]] to the United States to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with advisor Dr. [[Robin Hochstrasser]]. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with advisor Dr. [[Charles B. Harris]].

== Academic career ==
After some post doctorate work at [[UC-Berkeley]], he was awarded a faculty appointment at [[Caltech]] in 1976, where he has remained since. He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1982, and in 1990, he was made the first ''[[Linus Pauling]] Chair in Chemical Physics''.

Dr. Zewail has been nominated and will participate in President Barack Obama's Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The council will talk about education, science, defense, energy, the economy, and technology.

== Research ==
Zewail's key work has been as the pioneer     of [[femtochemistry]]&amp;mdash;i.e. the study of [[chemical reaction]]s across [[femtosecond]]s. Using a rapid [[ultrafast]] [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales - short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions.

In 1999, Zewail became the third ethnic [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] to receive the [[Nobel Prize]], following Egyptian president [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] (1978 in Peace) and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1988 in Literature). Other international awards include the [[Wolf Prize]] in Chemistry (1993) awarded to him by the [[Wolf Foundation]], the Tolman Medal (1997), the [[Robert A. Welch Award]] (1997), and the [[Priestley Medal]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] in 2011.<ref>"Zewail Wins 2011 Priestley Medal", Chemical &amp; Engineering News, p 5, June 21, 2010.</ref>  In 1999, he received Egypt's highest state honor, the [[Order of the Nile|Grand Collar of the Nile]].

Zewail was awarded a PHD Honoris Causa by [[Lund University]] in Sweden in May 2003 and is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] awarded him an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Science|Doctorate in Science]] in 2006. In May 2008, Zewail received a PhD Honoris Causa from [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. In February, 2009, Zewail was awarded an honorary PhD in arts and sciences by the [[University of Jordan]].<ref name="JT">{{cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/?news=14610&amp;searchFor=zewail|title=Egyptian Nobel laureate calls for ‘scientific renaissance’ in Arab world|last=Kheetan|first=Thameen|date=26 February 2009|work=Jordan Times|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> In May 2010, he received a PhD Honoris Causa in Humane Letters from [[Southwestern University]].

Zewail is married, and has four children.

== Political work ==
In his June 4, 2009 speech at [[Cairo University]], US President [[Barack Obama]] announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January, 2010 Ahmed Zewail, [[Elias Zerhouni]], and [[Bruce Alberts]] became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html America.gov]</ref>

When asked about the rumors that he might run for Egyptian presidential election in 2011 and his political ambitions, Ahmed Zewail Said: "I am a frank man .. I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist."<ref name="Zewail: I have no political ambitions ..

<title>Air cooling</title>
<text>[[File:Cooler Master V8.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Cooler Master]] V8 has a lot of [[heatpipe]]s.]]
'''Air cooling'''  is a method of dissipating [[heat]]. It works by making the object to be cooled have a larger surface area or have an increased flow of air over its surface, or both. An example of the former is to add [[heatsink |fin]]s to the surface of the object, either by making them integral or by attaching them tightly to the object's surface (to ensure efficient heat transfer). In the case of the latter it is done by using a [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] blowing [[air]] into or onto the object one wants to cool. In many cases the addition of fins adds to the total surface area making a [[heatsink]] that makes for greater efficiency in cooling. 

In all cases, the air has to be cooler than the object or surface from which it is expected to remove heat. This is due to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat will only move spontaneously from a hot reservoir (the heat sink) to a cold reservoir (the air).

==Examples==

[[File:R68-opposed-cylinders.jpg|thumb|Air-cooled [[Flat engine|''boxer'']] engine on a [[History of BMW motorcycles|1954 BMW motorcycle]]]]
===Vehicles===
Air is mainly used for [[Air-cooled engine | cooling]] [[internal combustion engines]] (ICE), particularly those powering aircraft, because it is a readily available fluid and is often at a suitable temperature to be used efficiently. While many such ICE are called "''liquid cooled''" the cooling liquid is usually cooled by air passing through a [[radiator]] or [[heat exchanger]]. Examples of direct air cooling in [[automobile]]s are rarer.  The most common example is the [[Flat engine|flat or ''Boxer'' engine]], once used extensively by [[Porsche]] and still in use on [[BMW Motorrad|BMW motorcycles]].  Notable past models include the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and related models, the [[Citroën 2CV]], the [[Chevrolet Corvair]], and the [[Porsche 911]] until 1998.

===Turbines===
Gas turbine engines (e.g. turbojets, turbofans, etc) incorporate turbines, which are exposed to the hot gases exiting the combustion chamber. Where necessary, relatively cold air is bled from the compression system and used to cool the turbine blades and vanes, to prevent them from melting.

===Electronics===
Its use is widespread in computers and [[CPU cooling]], where the computer [[central processing unit|processor]]s produce large quantities of heat that, if not dissipated, could damage the CPU and other electronic components.  In this case air has the advantage of being a good [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] too. However, in the future, new processors might generate too much heat to be dissipated through direct air cooling and it would follow that such direct cooling for computers and their components will become obsolete. [[Water cooling]] is somewhat popular in very high-power situations, such as large servers or heavily overclocked amateur systems.

===Industries===
A very large number of [[industry|industrial]] processes use air as a cooling medium, either directly or indirectly. [[Air conditioning]] is a very common process in which the air in a room, or a whole building, is cooled in order to maintain a comfortable environment for its occupants. Often the air has been cooled by chilled water or [[brine]] and the heat transferred to that medium is transported outside the building where, often, fan-driven water-to-air [[heat exchanger | heat exchanging]] is again effected to reject the heat into the atmosphere. A common sight around, for example, [[power station]]s are the large waisted concrete towers that emit steam more or less constantly. These are, in part, using air cooling on a grand scale.

{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
An '''air source [[heat pump]]''' uses outside air as a heat source or heat sink. A compressor, condenser and refrigerant system is used to absorb heat at one place and release it at another.

==General==
Outside [[air]], necessarily existing at some temperature above [[absolute zero]], is a heat container. An air-source heat pump moves ("pumps") some of this heat to provide hot water or household heating. This can be done in either direction, to cool or heat the interior of a building.

The main components of an air-source heat pump are:
* a heat exchanger, over which outside air is blown, to extract the heat from the air
* a compressor, which acts like a refrigerator but in reverse and raises the temperature from the outside air
* a way to transfer the heat into a hot water tank or heating system, such as radiators or under-floor heating tubes

==How air source heat pumps work==

[[File:Refrigerator-cycle.svg|thumb|A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor]]

Heating and cooling is accomplished by moving a [[refrigerant]] through the heat pump's various indoor and outdoor [[coil]]s and components.  A [[gas compressor|compressor]], [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], [[expansion valve]] and [[evaporator]] are used to change states of the refrigerant from a [[liquid]] to hot [[gas]] and from a gas to a cold liquid. The refrigerant is used to heat or cool coils in a [[building]] or [[room]] and [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] pull the room air over the coils. An external outdoor [[heat exchanger]] is used to heat or cool the refrigerant. This use of outside [[air]] has led to the term "Air Source" Heat Pump. The overall operation uses the concepts described in classic [[vapor compression refrigeration]].

When the liquid refrigerant at a low [[temperature]] passes through the outdoor evaporator coils, the temperature of the outside air causes the liquid to boil. This change of state from liquid to a vapor requires a considerable amount of [[energy]] or "[[latent heat]]" which is provided by outside air passing over the coils.

This [[vapor]] is then drawn into the compressor where the temperature of the vapor is boosted to well over 100 degrees [[Celsius]]. At this point we have used heat from the outside air to change the liquid refrigerant to a gas and added an amount of compression "work" to raise the temperature of the vapor. The vapor now enters the condenser heat exchanger coils where it begins to transfer heat to the air being drawn across the coils. As the vapor cools, it condenses back to a liquid and in so doing releases and transfers considerable latent heat to the air passing over the condenser unit coils. We have used the heat energy of outside air to change the phase of the refrigerant and then released this heat for heating, a typical [[heat pump]] operation.

At this stage we now have a very cold liquid refrigerant compressed to a high pressure. The refrigerant is next passed through an expansion [[valve]] which turns it back to a low pressure cold liquid ready to re-enter the evaporator to begin a new cycle.

The heat pump can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.

==Efficiency==
The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP). In simple terms, a COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes.  In mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4. However, on a very cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day. The heat pump's performance is limited by the [[Carnot cycle]] and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases at around −18 °C (0 °F) outdoor temperature for air source heat pumps.  However, heat pump construction methods that enable use of carbon dioxide refrigerant extend the figure downward to -30 °C (-22 °F).   A [[Geothermal heat pump]] will have less change in COP as the ground temperature from which they extract heat is more constant than outdoor air temperature.

Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the [[heating seasonal performance factor]] (HSPF) and [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER) respectively.

The efficiency of a heat pump can be significantly affected by its original design. Many air source heat pumps began life as air conditioning units, designed for summer temperatures. In [http://www.globalenergysystems.co.uk/features_products/why_eco_air_boilers.html designing a heat pump] as a heat pump from inception great COPs and life cycles can be attained. The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator to allow [http://www.globalenergysystems.co.uk/how_it_works/coefficient_performance.html COP] of greater than 2 even down to -20°C.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===

* Typically draws approximately 1/3 to 1/4 of the electricity of a standard [[resistance heater]] for the same amount of heating, reducing utility bills.<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia State University Heat Pump Notes|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heatpump.html}}</ref>  This typical efficiency compares to 70-95% for a fossil fuel-powered boiler{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.
* Few moving parts, reducing maintenance requirements. However, it should be ensured that the outdoor heat exchanger and fan is kept free from leaves and debris. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that a heat pump will have significantly more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater.
* As an electric system, no flammable or potentially asphyxiating fuel is used at the point of heating, reducing the potential danger to users, and removing the need to obtain gas or fuel supplies (except for electricity).
* May be used to heat air, or water.
* The same system may be used for air conditioning in summer, as well as a heating system in winter.
* lower running costs, the compressor being the thing that uses most power - when in comparison with traditional electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.

===Disadvantages===

The following disadvantages are associated with all air source heat pump designs:
*Air source heat pumps require electricity for operation. [[Electricity generation]] accounts for a significant amount of emissions pollutants and greenhouse gases.
*External space needs to be found for the outside condenser unit which can be somewhat noisy(comparable to an air conditioner unit) {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and possibly unsightly.
*The [[cost]] of installation is high (though less than a [[Geothermal heat pump|Ground Source heat pump]] because a ground source heat pump requires installation of a ground loop).

The following disadvantages are associated with units charged with [[Organofluorine_chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]]:
*Usually marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, the HFCs have the potential to contribute to global warming{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}.  The effect the refrigerant could have is measured in [[global warming potential]] (GWP) and [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP).
*Air source heat pumps lose their efficiency as external temperatures fall below 5 degrees celsius. In colder climates the system needs to be installed with an auxiliary source of heat to providing heat at low temperatures or if the heat pump should require repair.
*The outdoor section on some units may "frost up" when outdoor temperatures are between 0°C and 5°C and there is sufficient moisture in the air{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  which causes restriction of air flow across the outdoor coil.  These units employ a time/delay or demand defrost cycle where the system a) switches to "a/c" mode for up to 10 minutes to move heat from the home to the outdoor section to melt the ice and b) turns on the supplemental heater (resistance electric, gas, etc.) in the indoor section to temper the cold air being distributed.  The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less.  As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.  An air source heat pump switching out of defrost mode in normal operation emits a characteristic "whoosh" sound from the outdoor section.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
*The COP is reduced when heat pumps are used to reach over 60°C for heating domestic water or in conventional [[central heating]] systems using radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array).
*Retrofit is difficult when used with conventional heating systems using radiators or radiant panels. The lower Heat Pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature [[underfloor heating]] system be installed instead.

==Conclusions==

Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high efficiency heat pump can provide four times the heat compared to an electric heater.<ref>{{cite web|title=The magic behind air source heat pumps|url=http://www.daikinaltherma.eu/heat-pump-basics/default.jsp}}</ref>.

Air source heat pumps are sometimes used to provide hot water from a pressurized system up to temperatures of 55°C. To minimize the risk from [[Legionellosis]] it is advised that hot water is heated to above 60°C.

The overall lifetime costs for using air source heat pumps should be considered carefully as mains gas (where available) may be cheaper than electricity (although it has higher carbon emissions).

Air source heat pumps should last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions by Danfoss Heat Pumps|url=http://www.ecoheatpumps.co.uk/heat_pump_faq.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How air source heat pumps work from HomeTips.com|url=http://www.hometips.com/heatpumps-airsource.html}}</ref>

'''Aircrack-ng''' is a network software suite consisting of a detector, [[packet sniffer]], [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]/[[WPA2-PSK]] [[Wireless cracking|cracker and analysis]] tool for [[802.11]] [[wireless LAN]]s. It works with any [[Wireless network interface card|wireless card]] whose driver supports [[Monitor mode|raw monitoring mode]] (for a list, visit the website of the project or [http://wiki.remote-exploit.org/index.php/HCL:Wireless]) and can sniff [[802.11a]], [[802.11b]] and [[802.11g]] traffic. The program runs under [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]; the Linux version has been ported to the [[Sharp Zaurus|Zaurus]] and [[Maemo (operating system)|Maemo]] platforms, and a [[proof-of-concept]] port has been made to the [[iPhone]].

In April 2007 a team at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] in [[Germany]] developed a new attack method based on a paper released on the RC4 cypher by [[Adi Shamir]]. This new attack, named 'PTW', decreases the number of [[initialization vector]]s or IVs needed to decrypt a WEP key and has been included in the aircrack-ng suite since the 0.9 release.

Aircrack-ng is a fork of the original [[Aircrack]] project.

<title>Akaike information criterion</title>
<text>The '''Akaike information criterion''' is a measure of the [[goodness of fit]] of a [[statistical model]]. It was developed by [[Hirotsugu Akaike]], under the name of "an information criterion" ('''AIC'''), and was first published by Akaike in 1974.<ref name="Akaiki1974">Akaike, 1974</ref> It is grounded in the concept of [[information entropy]], in effect offering a relative measure of the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence|information lost]] when a given model is used to describe reality.  It can be said to describe the tradeoff between [[bias]] and [[variance]] in model construction, or loosely speaking that of accuracy and complexity of the model.

The AIC is not a test of the model in the sense of hypothesis testing; rather, it provides a means for comparison among models&amp;mdash;a tool for  [[model selection]]. Given a data set, several candidate models may be ranked according to their AIC, with the model having the minimum AIC being the best. From the AIC values one may also infer that e.g. the top two models are roughly in a tie and the rest are far worse.

==Definition==
In the general case, the AIC is

:<math>\mathit{AIC} = 2k - 2\ln(L)\,</math>

where ''k'' is the number of [[parameter]]s in the [[statistical model]], and ''L'' is the maximized value of the [[likelihood]] function for the estimated model.

Given a set of candidate models for the data, ''the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value.''  Hence AIC not only rewards goodness of fit, but also includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters. This penalty discourages [[overfitting]] (increasing the number of free parameters in the model improves the goodness of fit, regardless of the number of free parameters in the data-generating process). 

The AIC methodology attempts to find the model, among a candidate set of models, that best explains the data with the fewest free parameters. By contrast, more traditional approaches to modeling start from a [[null hypothesis]].

From a Bayesian perspective, the AIC corresponds to adopting a prior <math> P(k) \propto \exp{(-k)}</math>
to penalise models with large numbers of parameters <math>k</math>.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  The posterior is then
<math> P(k|data) \propto P(data|k) P(k) = \exp{(-\mathit{AIC}/2)}</math>.

==How to apply AIC in practice==
AIC estimates relative support for a model.  To apply this in practice, we start with a set of candidate models, and then find the models' corresponding AIC values.  Next, identify the minimum AIC value.  The selection of a model can then be made as follows.

<blockquote>As a rough rule of thumb, models having their AIC within 1&amp;ndash;2 of the minimum have substantial support and should receive consideration in making inferences.  Models having their AIC within about 4&amp;ndash;7 of the minimum have considerably less support, while models with their AIC &amp;gt; 10 above the minimum have either essentially no support and might be omitted from further consideration or at least fail to explain some substantial structural variation in the data.<ref>Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2002, p.446, slightly paraphrased</ref></blockquote>

==Partial derivation==
For this section, it will be assumed that the model errors are normally and independently distributed. Let ''n'' be the number of [[observation]]s and ''RSS'' be
:<math>\mathit{RSS} =  \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\varepsilon}_i^2,</math>
the [[residual sum of squares]]. We further assume that the variance of the model errors is unknown but equal for them all. Maximizing the likelihood with respect to this variance, the AIC becomes

:<math>\mathit{AIC}=2k + n[\ln(2\pi \mathit{RSS}/n) + 1]\,.</math>

This can be simplified by factoring out the term <math>n*\ln(2\pi)</math>. This is a constant term added to the AIC value of all the competing models. Therefore it can't affect the order in which we rank them and we can safely remove this term. When we also factor out the constant <math>n</math>, AIC simplifies to:

:<math>\mathit{AIC}=2k + n[\ln(\mathit{RSS})]\,.</math>

==Relevance to <math>\chi^2</math>-fitting==
Often, one wishes to select amongst competing models where the likelihood function assumes that the underlying errors are normally distributed and independent. This assumption leads to <math>\chi^2</math> data fitting.

For any set of models where the data points are used, one can use a slightly altered AIC. For the purposes of this article, this will be called <math>AIC_{\chi^2}</math>. It differs from the AIC only through an additive constant, which is a function only of the data points and not of the model. As only differences in the AIC are relevant, this constant can be ignored.

For <math>\chi^2</math> fitting, the likelihood is given by
:<math>L=\prod_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_i^2}\right)^{1/2} \exp \left( -\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(y_i-f(\mathbf{x}))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right)</math>
:<math>\therefore \ln L = \ln\left(\prod_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_i^2}\right)^{1/2}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(y_i-f(\mathbf{x}))^2}{\sigma_i^2}</math>
:<math>\therefore \ln L = C - \chi^2/2 \,</math>, where C is a constant independent of the model used, and dependent only on the use of particular data points. i.e. it does not change if the data do not change.

The AIC is therefore given by <math>AIC = 2k - 2\ln(L) = 2k - 2(C-\chi^2/2) = 2k -2C + \chi^2 \,</math>. As only differences in AICc are meaningful, the constant C can be omitted provided the same data points are used, giving
:<math>AIC_{\chi^2}=\chi^2 + 2k</math>

This form is often convenient in that data fitting programs produce <math>\chi^2</math> as a statistic for the fit. For models with the same number of data points, the one with the lowest <math>AIC_{\chi^2}</math> should be preferred.

Similarly, if one has available the statistic <math>R^2</math> ("Variance Explained"), one may write

:<math>AIC_{R^2}=n\ln\frac{1-R^2}{n}+2k.\ </math>

The Pearson correlation <math>r=R</math> is a special case of this. Here, independence of the observations is assumed.

==AICc and AICu==
AICc is AIC with a second-order correction for finite sample sizes:

:<math>AICc = AIC + \frac{2k(k + 1)}{n - k - 1} = \chi^2 + \frac{2k}{ 1 - \frac{k-1}{n} } .\,</math>

where ''k'' denotes the number of model parameters.  Burnham &amp; Anderson (2002) strongly recommend using AICc, rather than AIC, if ''n'' is small or ''k'' is large. Since AICc converges to AIC as ''n'' gets large, AICc generally should be employed regardless.<ref>Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2004</ref>  

Brockwell &amp; Davis (p.273) advise using AICc as the primary criterion in selecting the orders of an [[ARMA]] model for time series.

McQuarrie &amp; Tsai (1998: 22) define AICc as:

:<math>AICc = \ln{\frac{RSS}{n}} + \frac{n+k}{n-k-2}\ ,</math>

and propose (p. 32) the closely related measure:

:<math>AICu = \ln{\frac{RSS}{n-k}} + \frac{n+k}{n-k-2}\ .</math>

McQuarrie &amp; Tsai ground their high opinion of AICc and AICu on extensive simulation work.

==QAIC==
QAIC (the quasi-AIC) is defined as:

:<math>QAIC = 2k-\frac{1}{c}2\ln{L}\,</math>

where ''c'' is a variance inflation factor. QAIC adjusts for over-dispersion or lack of fit. The small sample version of QAIC is

:<math>QAICc = QAIC + \frac{2k(k + 1)}{n - k - 1}.\,</math>


==Schwarz criterion==
The AIC penalizes free parameters less strongly than does the [[Schwarz criterion]].  After Schwarz developed his [[Schwarz Information Criterion]] in 1978 using Bayesian formalism, Akaike was inspired to develop a Bayesian version of his information criteria as well often denoted the ABIC (for "a Bayesian Information Criterion") or commonly referred to as Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion. The fact that Akaike developed two similar Information Critera during the 1970's has created some confusion in the literature as to what is precisely the AIC. It is of the general form

:<math>\mathit{ABIC}=[-2\ln({L}_{marginal})+2(k)]\,.</math>

In a more tractable setting, the ABIC for a polynomial of degree k is, 

:<math>\mathit{ABIC}=n[\ln(\mathit{RSS})]+2k\,.</math>

Since the this information criterion has the same relationship to approximating the evidence (the likelihood probability times the prior probability), then it too can claim status as a Bayesian Information Criterion.

<title>Akiko (Amiga)</title>
<text>'''Akiko''' is a custom chip used in the [[Amiga CD32]] games console and forms part of the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset used in that system.

The Akiko chip performs '[[Packed pixel|chunky]]' to '[[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]]' graphics conversion in hardware. The Amiga's native display is a planar display which is simple and efficient to manipulate for routines like scrolling. However, chunky displays are faster and more efficient for 3D graphics manipulation. Akiko allows this conversion to be performed in hardware instead of relying on software conversion which would otherwise slow the system down. The conversion works by writing 32 chunky pixels to Akiko's registers and reading back eight 32-bit words of converted planar data which can then be copied to the display buffer.


Akiko is also responsible for implementing some of the control logic for the CD32's [[CD-ROM]] controller, as well as for controlling the serial ('AUX') port <ref>{{cite web|title=The Big Book of Amiga Hardware - Custom Chips: Akiko|url=http://bboah.amiga-resistance.info/cgi-bin/showhardware_en.cgi?HARDID=1449}}</ref>.

<title>Albert F. Case, Jr.</title>
<text>'''Albert F. Case, Jr.''' (born March 2, 1955) is an American [[software engineer]] and one of the leaders in the development of [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] (CASE) technologies and system development methodologies.

== Biography ==
Case is a graduate of the [[State University of New York]] at Buffalo. He began his software development career in 1972 and worked in a variety of IT-related capacities, including director of Management Information Systems for [[Ryder System]] and co-founder of Maximus Systems, Inc., developers of the Maximus code generator. In 1982, Case joined start-up [[Nastec Corporation]], a Southfield, Mich. based software development company. In 1989, Case left Nastec Corporation to join [[Gartner]], Inc. (then GartnerGroup),<ref>[http://www.Gartner.com/]</ref> the world's leading IT industry research and advisory firm, where he spent the next 13 years as a thought-leading industry analyst, speaker, writer and business executive. After 13 years, Case left Gartner to become an independent consulting executive and entrepreneur, with the goal of applying GST and "organizational engineering" in the laboratory of live businesses.

Case served as a board member for Sky Capital Holdings, a New York-based investment bank; interim president and CEO of DuoCash Corporation, an innovative payment processing services company; and still serves as chairman of the board of ''eNucleus, Inc''<ref>[http://www.enucleus.com eNucleus]</ref> (ENUI.OB) a global technology-based business process outsourcing firm; and president and CEO of Turbodyne Technologies, Inc. (TRBD.OB).<ref>[http://www.turbodyne.com/ Turbodyne Technologies, Inc.]</ref>

As an entrepreneur, Case is a co-founder and managing director of a variety of start up firms including content/commerce management software providers InfoTollgate.com <ref>[http://www.infotollgate.com/ InfoTollgate.com]</ref> (hosted content/commerce management systems) and Turnpike Software, LLC,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060408000649/www.infotollgate.com/home/index.php Turnpike Software, LLC]</ref> the content management software development company (with his partner Dr. N. [[Adam Rin]], former Bachman CASE tool and Gartner alumnus). He is also publisher and co-founder of IT procurement advisor TechSpend, LLC<ref>[http://www.techspend.com/ TechSpend, LLC]</ref> (with Gartner alumnus Vinnie Mirchandani).  He is also the Research Fellow and principal analyst with ES Research Group, Inc.,<ref>[http://www.esresearch.com/ ES Research Group, Inc.]</ref> which specializes in helping companies identify, select, implement and measure sales performance improvement programs.

== Work ==
Case of the leaders in the development of [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] (CASE) technologies and system development methodologies. He also was a major contributor to the ''Spectrum System Development Methodology'', from John D. Toellner Associates, developing the Structured Analysis and Structured Design design tips.

=== Computer-Aided Software Engineering ===
Nastec Corporation both coined the acronym CASE for [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] and launched the ''DesignAid'' analysis and design tool and the ''LifeCycle Manager'' project configuration and management system. For six years, Case served as Nastec's Vice President for Professional Services and Product Management. Case, and his associate [[Vaughn Frick]] developed a second generation structured analysis and design technique based on the Yourdon/Demarco/Constantine Structured Analysis/Structured Design technique. Frick, while working with Case at Nastec Corporation on the development of the PC-based DesignAid product, was the first to specify and teach a comprehensive technique for transforming a structured analysis specification into a structured design.

The revolutionary approach propelled Nastec Corporation into the leadership position in Analysis and Design professional education, and the Professional Services division quickly became not only the largest component of Nastec Corporation, but also the largest provider of [[SA/SD]] education.

Case was among the most prolific public speakers on the subject of CASE during the 1980s, helping launch, among other events, the Computer-Aided Software Engineering Symposium as its keynote speaker for its first two years. Case toured the country, promoting the integration of ''upper CASE'' and ''lower CASE'' with pro-football great and code-generation pioneer [[Fran Tarkenton]], founder of ''Tarkenton Software.''  When Tarkenton Software and Nastec Corporation agreed not to merge, Tarkenton teamed up with [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]] and merged Tarkenton Software into [[KnowledgeWare]], a direct competitor to Nastec.

=== Principles of Computer Aided Software Engineering ===
Case, also author of the book ''Information Systems Development: Principles of Computer Aided Software Engineering'' (Prentice Hall, 1986), was also a life long student of General Systems Theory (GST) and fascinated by the application of structured analysis and design techniques to the design of entire business operations, not just the information technology subsystems.

At Gartner, Case quickly ascended the analyst ranks, going from the leading Software Engineering analyst to head of its Business Process Reengineering practice - where he could spend full-time applying GST to business design, launching Gartner's e-Business Resource Center, its Vertical Industries practices and ultimately becoming the founder, group vice president and general manager of Gartner's TCO Software division. From there, Case became head of Gartner's IT benchmarking business and president of Gartner's eMetrix business performance management business. During his 13 year tenure at Gartner, Case launched dozens of product and service lines that accounted for over $100 million in revenue to Gartner.

=== Stamford Research ===
His firm Stamford Research, LLC,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080208125643/http://www.stamfordresearch.com/ Stamford Research, LLC]</ref> working with long-time business associates Arnold Kwong and Steve Vogel, is almost exclusively engaged as a "consulting executive" in which Case and his associates assume interim senior management roles with the client companies, bringing with them a global network of IT and business operations experts. Case himself characterizes the practice as focusing on two lines of business: Applying GST principles to help startups and fix "broken" companies.

'''Albert Gonzalez''' (born 1981) is a [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] and [[computer criminal]] who is accused of masterminding the combined [[credit card theft]] and subsequent reselling of more than 170 million card and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] [[Bank card number|numbers]] from 2005 through 2007—the biggest such fraud in history.

Gonzalez and his accomplices used [[SQL injection]] techniques to create [[malware]] [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] on several corporate systems in order to launch [[packet sniffing]] (specifically, [[ARP Spoofing]]) attacks which allowed him to [[Hacker (computer security)|steal computer data]] from internal corporate networks.

During his spree he was said to have thrown himself a $75,000 birthday party and complained about having to count $340,000 by hand after his [[currency-counting machine]] broke.  Gonzalez stayed at lavish hotels but his formal homes were modest.<ref name="MiamiHerald">[http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/1198469.html From snitch to cyberthief of the century – Miami Herald – August 22, 2009]</ref>

Gonzalez had three federal indictments:
*May 2008 in [[New York]] for the Dave &amp; Busters case (trial schedule September 2009)
*May 2008 in [[Massachusetts]] for the TJ Maxx case (trial scheduled early 2010)
*August 2009 in [[New Jersey]] in connection with the Heartland Payment case.

On March 25, 2010, Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

==Early life==
His parents, who had immigrated to the United States from [[Cuba]] in the 1970s, bought him his first computer when he was 8.  By the age of 9 he was reported to be actively removing [[computer virus]]es.<ref name="Young">[http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/1193994.html Miami hacker in credit card scam honed skills at early age – Miami Herald – August 20, 2009]</ref>

Gonzalez, a Cuban-American, attended [[South Miami High School]] in [[Miami, Florida]], where he was described as the "troubled" pack leader of computer nerds.<ref name="NYDN" />  In his senior year at the school he and friend used the library computer to hack into system of the government of [[India]] where they left messages about their culture. Reportedly India had to cancel government checks as a result.  Gonzalez was not charged and was warned to stay away from a computer for six months.<ref name="Young" />
In 2000 he moved to [[New York City]] where he lived for three months before moving to [[Kearny, New Jersey]].

==Shadowcrew==
{{main|ShadowCrew}}
While in Kearny he was accused of being the mastermind of a group of hackers called the  Shadowcrew group, which trafficked in 1.5 million stolen credit and ATM card numbers.<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136787/Government_informant_is_called_kingpin_of_largest_U.S._data_breaches Government informant is called kingpin of largest U.S. data breaches – Computer World – August 18, 2009]</ref> Although considered the mastermind of the scheme (operating on the site under the screen name of "CumbaJohnny"), he was not indicted.<ref name="usdoj.gov">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/firewallindct1028.pdf#search=%22firewallindct1028.pdf%22 Grand jury indictment of Shadowcrew]</ref> According to the indictment there were 4,000 people who registered with the Shadowcrew.com website. Once registered they could buy stolen account numbers or counterfeit documents at auction or read  “Tutorials and How-To’s” describing the use of [[cryptography]] in magnetic strips on credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards so that the numbers could be used.<ref name="usdoj.gov" /> Moderators of the website punished members who did not abide by the site's rules including providing refunds to buyers if the stolen card numbers proved invalid.<ref name="usdoj.gov" />

In addition to the card numbers, numerous other objects of identity theft were sold at auction, including counterfeit passports, drivers’ licenses, Social Security cards, credit cards, debit cards, birth certificates, college student identification cards, and health insurance cards.<ref name="usdoj.gov" /> One member sold 18 million e-mail accounts with associated usernames, passwords, dates of birth, and other personally identifying information. Most of those indicted were members who actually sold illicit items. Members who maintained or moderated the website itself were indicted including one who attempted to [[domain registration|register]] the [[.cc]] [[domain name]] Shadowcrew.cc<ref name="usdoj.gov" />

The Secret Service dubbed their investigation "Operation Firewall" and is believed that $4.3 million was stolen as Shadowcrew shared its information with other groups entitled Carderplanet and Darkprofits.  The investigation involved units from the United States, [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[the Netherlands]] and [[Ukraine]].<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/97017/Secret_Service_busts_online_organized_crime_ring Secret Service busts online organized crime ring – Computerworld – October 28, 2004]</ref> Gonzalez was initially charged with possession of 15 fake credit and debit cards<ref name="MiamiHerald"/> in [[Newark, New Jersey]], though he avoided jailtime by providing evidence to the [[United States Secret Service]] against his cohorts. 19 ShadowCrew members were indicted.<ref name="MiamiHerald"/> He then returned to Miami.<ref name="usdoj.gov" />

==TJX Companies==
While cooperating with authorities, he was said to have masterminded the hacking of [[TJX Companies]] in which 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18 month period ending in 2007 topping the 2005 breach of 40 million records at [[CardSystems Solutions]].<ref name="TJX">[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9014782/TJX_data_breach_At_45.6M_card_numbers_it_s_the_biggest_ever TJX data breach: At 45.6M card numbers, it's the biggest ever – Computerworld – March 29, 2007]</ref> Gonzalez and 10 others sought targets while [[wardriving]] and seeking vulnerabilities in [[wireless network]]s along [[U.S. Route 1]] in Miami.  They compromised cards at [[BJ's Wholesale Club]], [[DSW]], [[Office Max]], [[Boston Market]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Sports Authority]] and [[T.J. Maxx]].<ref name="DOJMASS">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/IDTheft/Gonzalez,%20Albert%20-%20Indictment%20080508.pdf Grand jury indictment, District of Massachusetts]</ref>

The indictment referred to Gonzalez by the [[User (computing)|screen names]] "cumbajohny", "[[The Soup Nazi|soupnazi]]", "segvec", "kingchilli" and "stanozlolz."<ref name="DOJMASS" />

The hacking was an embarrassment to TJ Maxx, which discovered the breach in December 2006. The company initially believed the intrusion began in May 2006, but further investigation revealed breaches dating back to July 2005.<ref name="TJX" />

One of his co-conspirators was 7-foot-tall Stephen Watt, known in the hacker world as "Unix Terrorist" and "Jim Jones." Watt worked at [[Morgan Stanley]] in New York City and wrote the sniffer program.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/watt | title=TJX Hacker Was Awash in Cash; His Penniless Coder Faces Prison | date= June 18, 2009 | publisher= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' }}</ref>

==Arrest==
Gonzalez was arrested on May 7, 2008 on charges stemming from hacking into the [[Dave &amp; Buster's]] corporate network from a [[point of sale]] location at a restaurant in [[Islandia, New York]].  The incident occurred in September 2007. About 5,000 card numbers were stolen.  Fraudulent transactions totaling $600,000 were reported on 675 of the cards.<ref name="D&amp;B">[http://www.csoonline.com/article/357068/Three_Charged_in_Dave_Buster_s_Hacking_Job Three Charged in Dave &amp; Buster's Hacking Job – csoonline.com – May 24, 2008]</ref>

Authorities became suspicious after the conspirators kept returning to the restaurant to reintroduce their hack because it would not restart after the company computers shut down.<ref name="D&amp;B" />

Gonzalez was arrested in Room 1508 at the [[National Hotel]]<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/nation/1729726,CST-NWS-hack23.article No hack as a hacker – Chicago Sun Times – August 23, 2009]</ref> in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. In various related raids authorities seized $1.6 million in cash (including $1.1 million in plastic bags in a three-foot drum buried in his parents' backyard),<ref name="MiamiHerald"/> his laptops and a compact [[Glock pistol]].<ref name="NYDN">[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/08/19/2009-08-19_soupnazi_nerdy_past.html 'Soupnazi' hacker Albert Gonzalez went from nerdy past to life of sex, guns and drugs – New York Daily News – August 19, 2009]</ref>

Officials said that Gonzalez lived in a nondescript house in Miami.<ref name="NYDN" />

He was in the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn|Metropolitan Detention Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] when he was indicted in the Heartland attacks.

==Heartland Payment Systems==
In August 2009 Gonzalez was indicted in Newark, New Jersey on charges dealing with hacking into the [[Heartland Payment Systems]], [[Citibank]]-branded [[7-Eleven]] ATM's and [[Hannaford Brothers]] computer systems.  Heartland bore the bulk of the attack in which 130 million card numbers were stolen.  Hannaford had 4.6 million numbers stolen.  Two other retailers were not disclosed in the indictment however Gonzalez's attorney told [[StorefrontBacktalk]] that two of the retailers were [[J.C. Penney]] and [[Target Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/j-c-penney-target-added-to-list-of-gonzalez-retail-victims/ J.C. Penney, Target Added To List Of Gonzalez Retail Victims – StorefontBackTalk – August 27, 2009]</ref> Heartland reported that it had lost $12.6 million in the attack including legal fees.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/tjx-hacker-charged-with-heartland/TJX Hacker Charged With Heartland, Hannaford Breaches – wired.com – August 17, 2009]</ref>  Gonzalez allegedly called the scheme "Operation Get Rich or Die Tryin."<ref name="MiamiHerald"/>

According to the indictment the attacks by Gonzalez and two unidentified hackers "in or near [[Russia]]" along with unindicted conspirator "P.T." from Miami began on December 26, 2007, at [[Heartland Payment Systems]], August 2007 against 7-Eleven and Hannaford Brothers in November 2007 and two other unidentified companies.<ref name="DOJNJ">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/press/files/pdffiles/GonzIndictment.pdf Grand jury indictment, District of New Jersey]</ref>
Gonzalez and his co-horts targeted large companies and studied their check out terminals and then attacked the companies from internet-connected computers in New Jersey, Illinois, [[Latvia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Ukraine]].

They covered their attacks over the Internet using more than one messaging screen name, storing data related to their attacks on multiple Hacking Platforms, disabling programs that logged inbound and outbound traffic over the Hacking Platforms, and disguising, through the use of “[[Proxy server|proxies]],” the Internet Protocol addresses from which their attacks originated.<ref name="DOJNJ" />

The indictment said the hackers tested their program against 20 [[anti virus programs]].

Rene Palomino Jr., attorney for Gonzalez, charged in a blog on the ''New York Times'' website that the indictment arose out of squabbling among U.S. Attorney offices in New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Palomino said that Gonzalez was in negotiations with New York and Massachusetts for a plea deal in connection with the T.J. Maxx case when New Jersey made its indictment.  Palomino identified the unindicted conspirator "P.T." as Damon Patrick Toey who had pled guilty in the T.J. Maxx case.  Palomino said Toey rather than Gonzalez was the ring leader of the Heartland case.  Palomino further said, “Mr. Toey has been cooperating since Day One. He was staying at (Gonzalez’s) apartment. This whole creation was Mr. Toey’s idea...It was his baby. This was not Albert Gonzalez. I know for a fact that he wasn’t involved in all of the chains that were hacked from New Jersey.”<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/gonzalez-case-raises-very-oid%E2%80%94and-very-frightening%E2%80%94retail-security-issues/ Gonzalez Case Raises Very OId Retail Security Issues – Storefrontbacktalk.com – August 23, 2009]</ref>

Palomino said one of the unnamed Russian hackers in the Heartland case was [[Maksym Yastremskiy]] who was also indicted in the T.J. Maxx but is now serving 30 years in a [[Turkey|Turkish]] prison on a charge of hacking Turkish banks in a separate matter.<ref>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/accused-hackers-lawyer-criticizes-federal-prosecutors/?hpw Hacking Suspect’s Lawyer Criticizes Federal Prosecutors – nytimes.com – August 19, 2009]</ref>  Investigators said  Yastremskiy and Gonzalez exchanged 600 messages and that Gonzalez paid him $400,000 through [[e-gold]].<ref name="MiamiHerald"/>

Yastremskiy was arrested in July 2007 in Turkey on charges of hacking into 12 banks in [[Turkey]].  The Secret Service investigation into him was used to build the case against Gonzalez including a [[sneak and peek warrant|sneak and peek]] covert review of Yastremskiy's laptop in [[Dubai]] in 2006 and a review of the [[disk image]] of the Latvia computer leased from [[Cronos IT]] and alleged to have been used in the attacks.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/gonzalez-evidence/ In Gonzalez Hacking Case, a High-Stakes Fight Over a Ukrainian’s Laptop – Wired – August 20, 2009]</ref>

After the indictment Heartland issued a statement saying that it does not know how many card numbers were stolen from the company and that it does not know how the U.S. government reached the 130 million number.<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/gonzalez-the-al-capone-of-cyber-thieves/ Gonzalez: The Al Capone Of Cyber Thieves? – storefrontbacktalk.com – August 19, 2009]</ref>

==Plea bargain==
On August 28, 2009, his attorney filed papers with the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] in Boston indicating that he would plead guilty to all 19 charges in the U.S. v. Albert Gonzalez, 08-CR-10223, case (the TJ Maxx case).  According to reports this [[plea bargain]] would "resolve" issues with the New York case of U.S. v. Yastremskiy, 08-CR-00160 in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] (the Dave and Busters case).

Gonzalez could serve a term of 15 years to 25 years. He would forfeit more than $1.65 million, a condominium in Miami, a blue 2006 [[BMW 330i]] automobile, [[IBM]] and [[Toshiba]] laptop computers, a Glock 27 firearm, a [[Nokia]] cell phone, a [[Tiffany]] diamond ring and three [[Rolex]] watches. 

His sentence would run concurrent with whatever comes out of the case in the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] (meaning that he would serve the longest of the sentences he receives).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/technology/29hacker.html Man Accused of Stealing Stores’ Data Pleads Guilty – New York Times – August 29, 2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aXHW5gbDC0EA Computer Hacker Gonzalez to Admit Guilt, Forfeit $1.65 Million – Bloomberg – August 29, 2009]</ref>

In March 2010, he received two concurrent 20 year terms.<ref name="NYTimesMag">{{cite news |title=The Great Cyberheist |author=James Verini |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 10, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Hacker-t.html |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}

'''Alberto O. Mendelzon''' was an Argentine-Canadian [[computer scientists|computer scientist]] who died on June 16, 2005.

Alberto Mendelzon was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He received a Ph.D. degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1979, where his advisor was [[Jeffrey Ullman]]. After that he was a post-doctoral fellow at the [[IBM T.J. Watson Research Center]] for a year before joining the faculty of the [[University of Toronto]] in 1980.

He was one of the pioneers who helped to lay the foundations of [[relational databases]]. His early work on database dependencies has been influential in both the theory and practice of data management. He has made fundamental contributions in the areas of graphical query languages, knowledge-base systems, and on-line analytic processing. His work has provided the foundation for languages used to query the structure of the web.

Mendelzon established some of the earliest results on using the relational data model. Together with his thesis advisor, [[Jeffrey Ullman]], and fellow Princeton students, including [[David Maier]] and [[Yeshoshua Sagiv]], he co-authored a number of influential papers that laid out the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases. In a now-famous paper (Maier, Mendelzon and Sagiv, TODS 1979), he introduced the [[chase (database theory)|chase]], a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the [[database theory]] literature. This work has been highly influential: it is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered.

In the 1980s, Mendelzon began an important line of work on graphical query languages. His work has been called prescient as it began before the [[World Wide Web]], and nonetheless established many of the scientific principles required for designing languages to query the Web.

More recently, Mendelzon was a central figure in the work on view-based querying. Starting with the innovative LMSS95 paper (Levy, Mendelzon, Sagiv, and Srivastava, PODS 1995) that introduced the problem of answering queries using views, Alberto Mendelzon made several important contributions to the emerging area of view-based modeling and processing.

His research was central to the development of many areas of database research such as database design, semantic [[query optimization]], graphical query languages, and querying web data. In addition, he also made important contributions to recursive query languages, on-line analytic processing, similarity-based queries, data warehouses and view maintenance, algorithms for computing web page reputations, and indexing of [[XML]] data.

Mendelzon was an active member of both the [[database theory]] and [[database systems]] research communities. He served as the PC Chair for ACM [[PODS]] in 1991 and as General Chair in both 1997 and
1998. He served as PC Chair for [[VLDB]] in 1992, and as a member of the [[SIGMOD]] Executive Committee from 1998 to 2001. He was a member of the [[Royal Society of Canada]].

'''Alchemy CATALYST''' is a software [[Internationalization and localization|localisation]] suite which is developed by Alchemy Software Development Limited.

==History==
Alchemy Software Development Limited was founded by Enda McDonnell and Tony O’Dowd the original developers of Corel Catalyst. It acquired the Corel Catalyst software which was initially owned by Corel Corporation Limited, in a deal which saw Corel gain a stake of 24.9% equity interest in the newly formed company. On March 6 2008 Alchemy Software development merged with Translations.com a provider of software localisation and Globalization Management system technology . The headquarters of Alchemy Software Development Limited are located in Dublin. The company also has offices located in Japan, Germany and the USA.  Catalyst 9.0 was released late 2010.<ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/company/news/pr_001130.html</ref>

==Alchemy CATALYST 8.0==
Alchemy CATALYST is a software localisation tool and was one of the first tools that contained integrated [[translation memory]] technology. The latest version of Alchemy CATALYST version 8.0 was released on the 14th of February 2009.Alchemy CATALYST 8.0  is an Object Oriented localization environment. <ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/estore/order_catalyst_7.html</ref>

===Alchemy Experts===
Alchemy Experts are automation processes designed to omit repetitive tasks within the localisation process. The following are experts found in Alchemy Catalyst:
#	'''Validate Expert''': This expert detects,locates and fixes common errors that can occur in the localisation procedure such as incorrect spellings and truncated text.The Runtime Validate Expert which accompanies the Validate Expert in the Localizer Edition and Developer/Pro Editions allows the user to carry out this process while the software is running.
#	'''Pseudo-Translate Text''': This expert allows the user to pseudo-translate the [[translation]] which is the process of creating text that mimics a foreign language without the benefit of actual [[translation]] into another language.<ref>http://www.inter-locale.com/demos/pseudo.jsp</ref>
#	'''Visual Comparison Expert''': This is used to compare the changes in two application files and detect missing resources.
#	'''Leverage Expert''': This allows the user to reuse TM files using Alchemy CATALYST'S ezMatch [[translation memory]] technology.  These files are stored in .ttk, .tmx and .tmx format.
#       '''Layout Manager''': The Layout Manager allows the user to automatically create localised layouts by resizing controls,dialogs and buttons ensuring that any text that has expanded during the [[translation]] process will fit appropriately on the user interface.
#       '''QuickShip Expert''': The Quickship Expert is used to distribute files to translators. It does this by placing all project TTK files, glossary files and user instructions into a compressed executable file known as a Quickship bundle.  The QuickShip bundle which is sent to the translator extracts all constituent files and attaches any glossary files to the translators version of Alchemy CATALYST'S Translator/Lite which is then launched.  <ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/products/productline.html</ref>
#       '''Analysis Expert''': This expert allows the user to perform an analysis of the project to determine the actual parts that need to be translated ensuring reduced costs.  It does this by determining the amount of fuzzy-matches which can be re-used,counting the number of words which are repeated throughout and counting the number of matching segments which occur between the TTK project files and the [[translation memory]].  All numerical data and keyword matches which are found through carrying out the analysis are omitted meaning the user only has to pay for content that needs to be translated.
#      ''' Update Expert''': This updates files by replacing application files with their revised editions.[[Translation]] leverage is also carried out during this procss.

<title>Alethic modality</title>
<text>{{for|the concept in modal logic|Subjunctive possibility}}

'''Alethic modality''' is a [[linguistic modality]] which indicates logical necessity, possibility or impossibility.<ref name="SIL">{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsAlethicModality.htm|title=What is alethic modality?|publisher=SIL International|work=Glossary of linguistic terms|last=Loos|first=Eugene E.|coauthors=Susan Anderson; Dwight H. Day, Jr.; Paul C. Jordan; J. Douglas Wingate|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>

It has been questioned whether this modality should be considered distinct from [[epistemic modality]] which denotes the speaker's evaluation or judgment of the truth. The criticism states that there is no real difference between "the truth in the world" (alethic) and "the truth in an individual's mind" (epistemic).<ref>{{cite book|last=Eschenroeder|first=Erin|coauthors=Sarah Mills; Thao Nguyen|title=The Expression of Modality|editor=William Frawley|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|date=2006-09-30|series=The Expression of Cognitive Categories|pages=8–9|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=72URszHq2SEC&amp;pg=PT18|isbn=3110184362|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a [[grammatical mood]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nuyts|first=Jan|title=Epimestic Modality, Language, and Conceptualization: A Cognitive-pragmatic Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co|date=November 2000|series=Human Cognitive Processing|page=28|isbn=9027223572}}</ref>

<title>Alex Martelli</title>
<text>[[Image:Alex-Martelli.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alex Martelli in Argentina (''Cafeconf'' 2006)]]
'''Alex Martelli''' (born October 5, 1955) is an Italian computer engineer and member of the [[Python Software Foundation]]. Since early 2005, he worked as "Über Tech Lead" for [[Google]], Inc. in [[Mountain View, California]].  He holds a [[Laurea]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Bologna University]] (1980); he is the author of ''[[Python in a Nutshell]]'', co-editor of the ''[[Python Cookbook]]'', and has written other (mostly Python-related) materials.  Martelli won the 2002 Activators' Choice Award, and the 2006 Frank Willison award for outstanding contributions to the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] community.

Before joining Google, Martelli spent a year designing chips with [[Texas Instruments]]; 8 years with [[IBM Research]], gradually shifting from hardware to software, and winning three Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards; 12 as Senior Software Consultant at [[think3, Inc.]], developing libraries, network protocols, GUI engines, event frameworks, and web access frontends; and 3 more as a freelance consultant, working mostly for [[Open End AB]], a Python-centered software house (formerly known as  [[Strakt AB]]) located in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].  He has taught courses on programming, development methods, [[object-oriented design]], and numerical computing, at [[University of Ferrara|Ferrara University]] and other schools.  According to Martelli's self-evaluation, his proudest achievement is the articles that appeared in [[The Bridge World]] (January/February 2000), which were hailed as giant steps towards solving issues that had haunted [[Contract bridge|contract-bridge]] theoreticians for decades. Martelli was also the keynote speaker for the 2008 [[SciPy]] Conference.

He is also noted for coining the phrase [[Duck typing]].

<title>Alexander Brudno</title>
<text>'''Alexander Brudno''' ('''Aleksandr L'vovich Brudno''') ({{lang-ru|Александр Львович Брудно}}) (January 10, 1918-December 1, 2009) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[computer science|computer scientist]], best known for fully describing the [[alpha-beta pruning|alpha-beta]] (α-β) [[search algorithm]].<ref name="Marsland"/> Since 1991 he lived in Israel.
==Biography==
Brudno developed the "mathematics/machine interface" for the [http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/m2.htm M-2] computer constructed in 1952 at the Krzhizhanovskii laboratory of the Institute of Energy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="LY"/><ref name="M-2"/> He was a great friend of [[Alexander Kronrod]].

Brudno's work on alpha-beta was published in 1963 in Russian and English.

The algorithm was used in computer [[chess]] program written by [[Georgy Adelson-Velsky]] and others at the [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]] (ITEF or ITEP). According to Monty Newborn and the [[Computer History Museum]], the algorithm was used later in [[Kaissa]] the world computer chess champion in 1974.

==Early alpha-beta==
[[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert Simon]] who used what [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] calls an "approximation"<ref name="JMC"/> in 1958 wrote that alpha-beta "appears to have been reinvented a number of times".<ref name="NS"/> [[Arthur Samuel]] had an early version and Richards, Hart, Levine and/or Edwards found alpha-beta independently in the [[United States]].<ref name="Richard-Hart"/>{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} McCarthy proposed similar ideas during the [[Dartmouth Conference]] in 1956 and suggested it to a group of his students including [[Alan Kotok]] at MIT in 1961.<ref name="AIM41"/> [[Donald Knuth]] and Ronald W. Moore refined the algorithm In 1975<ref name="Knuth-Moore"/><ref name="Abramson"/> and it continued to be advanced.

'''Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov''' ({{lang|ru|Алексей Леонидович Пажитнов}}, transliterated as Aleksei Leonidovich Pazhitnov,
<!-- but he prefers the spelling Pajitnov, as explained on the talk page -->
born 1956) is a [[computer]] engineer from [[Russia]] {{As of|2007|alt=now}} living in the [[United States]], who developed the popular game ''[[Tetris]]'' while working for the [[Dorodnicyn Computing Center|Computing Center]] of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet government]]-founded [[R&amp;D]] center.

Despite being the developer of Tetris, Pajitnov did not profit from his creation, as rights were owned by his employer, the Soviet government, which distributed it freely throughout the USSR and Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|author=4 maart 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidxG-ah3y8 |title=Tetris 1985 History of Games part 07 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> He only started profiting from his creation by 1996 when he and [[Henk Rogers]] formed [[The Tetris Company]].<ref>http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/tetrishist.html</ref>

==Biography==
Alexey Pajitnov created ''Tetris'' with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] in 1985. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in [[Western world|the West]] in 1986.
Pajitnov also created the lesser known sequel to ''Tetris'', entitled ''[[Welltris]]'', which has the same principle but in a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] environment where you see the "board" from above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mds.mdh.se/~frv95pen/game/tetris/welltris/ |title=Screenshots from Welltris, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Mds.mdh.se |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> ''Tetris'' was licensed and managed by Soviet company Elorg which had been founded specially for this purpose, and advertised with the slogan ''"From Russia with Love"'' (on NES: ''"From Russia With Fun!"''). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties. Pajitnov, together with [[Vladimir Pokhilko]], moved to the [[United States]] in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded ''The Tetris Company'' with Henk Rogers.

He helped design the puzzles in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] versions of ''[[Yoshi's Cookie]]'' and designed the game ''[[Pandora's Box (computer game)|Pandora's Box]]'', which incorporates more traditional [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw-style puzzles]].

He began working for [[Microsoft]] in October 1996. Pajitnov worked for the [[Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection]], MSN Mind Aerobics and [[MSN Games]] groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of ''[[Hexic]]'', ''Hexic HD'', was included with every new [[Xbox 360]] Premium package. He left Microsoft in 2005.

On August 18, 2005 WildSnake Software announced Pajitnov will be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildsnake.com/newsletter/2005-08-18/ |title=WildSnake newsletter august 18 2005, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Wildsnake.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

<title>Algebraic Petri nets</title>
<text>'''Algebraic Petri Net (APN)''' is an evolution of the well known '''[[Petri net]]''' in which elements of '''User Deﬁned Data Types''' (called '''Algebraic Abstract Data Types (AADT)'''<ref>Ehrig, H. and Mahr, B. 1985 Fundamentals of Algebraic Specification I. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.</ref>) replace black tokens. This formalism can be compared to Coloured Petri Nets [[CPN]]<ref>K. Jensen. Coloured Petri Nets. Springer, Berlin, 1996. </ref> in many aspects. However, in the APN case, the
semantics of the data types is given by an axiomatization enabling proofs and computations on it.

'''Algebraic Petri Nets'''<ref>Jacques Vautherin: Parallel systems specifications with [[Coloured Petri nets]] and algebraic specifications. European Workshop on Applications and Theory of Petri Nets 1986: 293-308</ref> were invented by Jacques Vautherin in 85 in is PhD thesis and later improved by Wolfang Reisig<ref>Wolfgang Reisig: Petri Nets and Algebraic Specifications. Theor. Comput. Sci. 80(1): 1-34 (1991)</ref>.

The formalism has two aspects :
* The control part which is handled by a Petri Net.
* The data part which is handled by one or many AADTs.

AADT can be themselves split in two part : 
* The '''signature''' (Sort and Ops in the example below) which gives the valid constants and operations of the [[term algebra]].
* The '''axiomatization''' (Axioms in the example below) which gives the semantic of the operations described in the signature part.

The following picture describes an Algebraic Petri Net model of the Dining Philosophers problem. There are two '''AADT''' in this model, one for the forks algebra, one for the philosophers algebra. Please note that the philosophers AADT uses the fork AADT. Since all philosophers can take their left fork without taking their right fork, executing this model can result in a '''deadlock'''.

The control part is composed of :
* '''Places''' contain '''[[Multiset]]''' (bags) of tokens. Those tokens are elements of a [[term algebra]] built upon the signature of the '''AADT'''(in the example, terms that represent either a philosopher or a fork). Each place contains one and only one multiset of terms, the place is typed by its multiset.
*'''Arcs''' can be labeled with multisets of either closed or free terms. Again terms are built from the AADT signature.
* '''Transitions''' are events that can be fired whenever there are enough resources (namely enough tokens in the input places to satisfy all the input arcs) and the guard (firing conditions) of the transition holds. Then the produced tokens are put in the target places of the output arcs. Usually Term [[Rewriting]]<ref>Dick, A. J. and Watson, P. 1991. Order-sorted term rewriting. Comput. J. 34, 1 (Feb. 1991), 16-19.</ref> is used for the operational semantics in order to check if conditions hold and to compute output terms.

In the example below only transition '''goEat''' is firable at the beginning. One '''goEat''' has been fired, '''takeL''' and '''takeR''' are also enabled and thus can also be fired.

<title>Algebraic topology</title>
<text>{{For|the topology of pointwise convergence|Algebraic topology (object)}}
'''Algebraic topology''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which uses tools from [[abstract algebra]] to study [[topological space]]s. The basic goal is to find algebraic [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] that [[classification theorem|classify]] topological spaces [[up to]] [[homeomorphism]], though usually most classify up to [[Homotopy#Homotopy_equivalence_and_null-homotopy|homotopy equivalence]].

Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a [[free group]] is again a free group.

==The method of algebraic invariants==

An older name for the subject was [[combinatorial topology]], implying an emphasis on how a space X was constructed from simpler ones (the modern standard tool for such construction is the [[CW complex|CW-complex]]). The basic method now applied in algebraic topology is to investigate spaces via algebraic invariants by mapping them, for example, to [[group (mathematics)|groups]] which have a great deal of manageable structure in a way that respects the relation of [[homeomorphism]] (or more general [[homotopy]]) of spaces.  This allows one to recast statements about topological spaces into statements about groups, which are often easier to prove.

Two major ways in which this can be done are through [[fundamental group]]s, or more generally [[homotopy theory]], and through [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology]] groups. The fundamental groups give us basic information about the structure of a topological space, but they are often [[abelian group|nonabelian]] and can be difficult to work with. The fundamental group of a (finite) [[simplicial complex]] does have a finite [[presentation of a group|presentation]].

Homology and cohomology groups, on the other hand, are abelian and in many important cases finitely generated. [[Finitely generated abelian group]]s are completely classified and are particularly easy to work with.

==Setting in category theory==
In general, all constructions of algebraic topology are [[category theory|functorial]]; the notions of [[Category (mathematics)|category]], [[functor]] and [[natural transformation]] originated here. Fundamental groups and homology and cohomology groups are not only ''invariants'' of the underlying topological space, in the sense that two topological spaces which are [[homeomorphic]] have the same associated groups, but their associated morphisms also correspond — a continuous mapping of spaces induces a group homomorphism on the associated groups, and these homomorphisms can be used to show non-existence (or, much more deeply, existence) of mappings.

==Results on homology==
Several useful results follow immediately from working with finitely generated abelian groups. The free rank of the ''n''-th homology group of a simplicial complex is equal to the ''n''-th [[Betti number]], so one can use the homology groups of a simplicial complex to calculate its [[Euler-Poincaré characteristic]]. As another example, the top-dimensional integral homology group of a closed [[manifold]] detects [[orientable|orientability]]: this group is isomorphic to either the integers or 0, according as the manifold is orientable or not. Thus, a great deal of topological information is encoded in the homology of a given topological space.

Beyond simplicial homology, which is defined only for simplicial complexes, one can use the differential structure of smooth manifolds via [[de Rham cohomology]], or Čech or [[sheaf cohomology]] to investigate the solvability of [[differential equation]]s defined on the manifold in question. [[De Rham]] showed that all of these approaches were interrelated and that, for a closed, oriented manifold, the Betti numbers derived through simplicial homology were the same Betti numbers as those derived through de Rham cohomology. This was extended in the 1950s, when Eilenberg and Steenrod generalized this approach. They defined homology and cohomology as [[functors]] equipped with [[natural transformations]] subject to certain axioms (e.g., a [[weak equivalence]] of spaces passes to an isomorphism of homology groups), verified that all existing (co)homology theories satisfied these axioms, and then proved that such an axiomatization uniquely characterized the theory.

A new approach uses a  functor from filtered spaces to crossed complexes  defined directly and homotopically using relative homotopy groups; a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem proved for this functor enables basic results in algebraic topology, especially on the border between homology and homotopy, to be obtained without using [[singular homology]] or [[simplicial approximation]]. This approach is also called [[higher dimensional algebra|nonabelian algebraic topology]], and generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the fundamental group.

==Applications of algebraic topology==
Classic applications of algebraic topology include:
* The [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]]: every [[continuous function|continuous]] map from the unit ''n''-disk to itself has a fixed point.
* The ''n''-sphere admits a nowhere-vanishing continuous unit [[vector fields on spheres|vector field]] if and only if ''n'' is odd. (For ''n'' = 2, this is sometimes called the "[[hairy ball theorem]]".)
* The [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]]: any continuous map from the ''n''-sphere to Euclidean ''n''-space identifies at least one pair of antipodal points.
* Any subgroup of a [[free group]] is free. This result is quite interesting, because the statement is purely algebraic yet the simplest proof is topological. Namely, any free group ''G'' may be realized as the fundamental group of a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] ''X''. The main theorem on [[covering space]]s tells us that every subgroup ''H'' of ''G'' is the fundamental group of some covering space ''Y'' of ''X''; but every such ''Y'' is again a graph. Therefore its fundamental group ''H'' is free.

On the other hand this type of application is also handled by the use of covering morphisms of [[groupoids]], and that technique has yielded subgroup theorems not yet proved by methods of algebraic topology (see the book by Higgins listed under groupoids).

<title>Algorithmic game theory</title>
<text>'''Algorithmic game theory''' is an area in the intersection of [[Game Theory]] and [[Algorithm Design]], whose objective is to design algorithms in [[strategic]] environments. Typically, in Algorithmic Game Theory problems, the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output. In those situations, the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests. On top of the usual requirements in classical algorithm design, say ''polynomial-time running time'', ''good approximation ratio'', ... the designer must also care about incentive constraints. We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives:

* ''Analysis'': look at the current implemented algorithms and analyze them using Game Theory tools: calculate and prove properties on their [[Nash equilibria]], [[Price of Anarchy]], best-response dynamics ...
* ''Design'': design games that have both good game-theoretical and algorithmic properties. This area is called [[Algorithmic Mechanism Design]]

The field was started when Nisan and Ronen in STOC'99 <ref name="nr">Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen, [http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~noam/selfishJ.ps Algorithmic Mechanism Design], STOC'99</ref> drawn the attention of the Theoretical Computer Science community to designing algorithms for selfish (strategic) users. As they claim in the abstract:

{{Quote|We consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants annot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents’ interests are best served by behaving correctly.

Following notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism. The payments should be carefully chosen a6 to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes. We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in
particular to the shortest path problem.}}



==The Internet as a catalyst==
The Internet created a new economy – both as a foundation for exchange and commerce, and in its own right. The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy. On the other hand, the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many. This was new to the classic, ‘top-down’ approach to computation that held till then. Thus, game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it, both human and mechanical.

Game theory studies equilibria (such as the [[Nash equilibrium]]). An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy. Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet, for instance financial interactions and communication load-balancing{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria, and a common approach is then to ‘find the game’ – that is, to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game, and to derive the associated equilibria.

Rephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet-based interactions and the construction of mechanisms to meet specified demands. If equilibria can be shown to exist, a further question must be answered: can an equilibrium be found, and in reasonable time? This leads to the [[analysis of algorithms]] for finding equilibria. Of special importance is the complexity class [[PPAD]], which includes many problems in algorithmic game theory.

==Areas of research==
The main areas of research in algorithmic game theory include:

* [[Algorithmic mechanism design]]
* Inefficiency of equilibria ([[Price of Anarchy]])
* [[Computational complexity|Complexity]] of finding equilibria
* [[Market equilibrium]]
* [[Multi agent systems]]
* [[Computational social choice]]

And the area counts with diverse practical applications:

* [[Routing]]
* [[P2P]] systems
* [[AdAuctions]]

<title>Algorithmic information theory</title>
<text>{{Expert-subject|Computer science|date=November 2008}}

'''Algorithmic information theory''' is a subfield of [[information theory]] and [[computer science]] that concerns itself with the relationship between [[theory of computation|computation]] and [[Information#Measuring information|information]]. According to [[Gregory Chaitin]], it is "the result of putting [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s information theory and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s computability theory into a cocktail shaker and shaking vigorously." <ref>[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/groups/CDMTCS/docs/ait.php Algorithmic Information Theory<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Overview ==
Algorithmic information theory principally studies [[asymptotic complexity|complexity]] measures on [[string (computer science)|string]]s (or other [[data structure]]s).  Because most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings, or as the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of strings, it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects, including [[integer]]s and [[real number]]s.

This use of the term "information" might be a bit misleading, as it depends upon the concept of compressibility. Informally, from the point of view of algorithmic information theory, the information content of a string is equivalent to the length of the shortest possible self-contained representation of that string. A self-contained representation is essentially a [[program (computing)|program]] – in some fixed but otherwise irrelevant universal [[programming language]] – that, when run, outputs the original string.

From this point of view, a 3000 page encyclopedia actually contains less information than 3000 pages of completely random letters, despite the fact that the encyclopedia is much more useful. This is because to reconstruct the entire sequence of random letters, one must know, more or less, what every single letter is. On the other hand, if every vowel were removed from the encyclopedia, someone with reasonable knowledge of the English language could reconstruct it, just as one could likely reconstruct the sentence "Ths sntnc hs lw nfrmtn cntnt" from the context and consonants present. For this reason, high-information strings and sequences are sometimes called "random"; people also sometimes attempt to distinguish between "information" and "useful information" and attempt to provide rigorous definitions for the latter, with the idea that the random letters may have more information than the encyclopedia, but the encyclopedia has more "useful" information.

Unlike classical information theory, algorithmic information theory gives [[Formal system|formal]], [[Rigour#Mathematical_rigour|rigorous]] definitions of a [[Kolmogorov complexity|random string]] and a [[algorithmically random sequence|random infinite sequence]] that do not depend on physical or philosophical [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]s about [[nondeterminism]] or [[likelihood]]. (The set of random strings depends on the choice of the universal Turing machine used to define Kolmogorov complexity, but any choice
gives identical asymptotic results because the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is invariant up to an additive constant depending only on the choice of universal Turing machine. For this reason the set of random infinite sequences is independent of the choice of universal machine.)

Some of the results of algorithmic information theory, such as [[Kolmogorov complexity#Chaitin's incompleteness theorem|Chaitin's incompleteness theorem]], appear to challenge common mathematical and philosophical intuitions. Most notable among these is the construction of [[Chaitin's constant]] '''Ω''', a real number which expresses the probability that a self-delimiting universal Turing machine will [[halting problem|halt]] when its input is supplied by flips of a fair coin (sometimes thought of as the probability that a random computer program will eventually halt). Although '''Ω''' is easily defined, in any [[consistent]] [[axiom]]atizable [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] one can only compute finitely many digits of '''Ω''', so it is in some sense ''unknowable'', providing an absolute limit on knowledge that is reminiscent of [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]]. Although the digits of '''Ω''' cannot be determined, many properties of '''Ω''' are known; for example, it is an [[algorithmically random sequence]] and thus its binary digits are evenly distributed (in fact it is [[normal number|normal]]).

==History==
Algorithmic information theory was founded by [[Ray Solomonoff]]<ref>Vitanyi, P. "[http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/obituary.html Obituary: Ray Solomonoff, Founding Father of Algorithmic Information Theory"]</ref>, who published the basic ideas on which the field is based as part of his invention of [[algorithmic probability]] - a way to overcome serious problems associated with the application of Bayes rules in statistics.  He first described his results at a Conference at [[Caltech]] in 1960,<ref>Paper from conference on "Cerebral Systems and Computers", California Institute of Technology, Feb 8-11, 1960, cited in "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part 1, 1964, p. 1</ref> and in a report, Feb. 1960, "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference."<ref>Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference]", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma., (November Revision of Feb 4, 1960 report.)</ref>  Algorithmic information theory was later developed independently by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], in 1965 and [[Gregory Chaitin]], around 1966.

There are several variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information; the most widely used one is based on [[self-delimiting program]]s and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974). [[Per Martin-Löf]] also contributed significantly to the information theory of infinite sequences. An axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in a paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (Burgin 1982). The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches in the algorithmic information theory. It is possible to treat different measures of algorithmic information as particular cases of axiomatically defined measures of algorithmic information. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).

== Precise Definitions ==

{{Main|Kolmogorov Complexity}}
A binary string is said to be random if the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of the string is at least the length of the string. A simple counting argument shows that some strings of any given length are random, and almost all strings are very close to being random. Since Kolmogorov complexity depends on a fixed choice of universal Turing machine (informally, a fixed "description language" in which the "descriptions" are given), the collection of random strings does depend on the choice of fixed universal machine. Nevertheless, the collection of random strings, as a whole, has similar properties regardless of the fixed machine, so one can (and often does) talk about the properties of random strings as a group without having to first specify a universal machine.

{{Main|Algorithmically random sequence}}
An infinite binary sequence is said to be random if, for some constant ''c'', for all n, the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of the initial segment of length ''n'' of the sequence is at least ''n-c''. Importantly, the complexity used here is prefix-free complexity; if plain complexity were used, there would be no random sequences. However, with this definition, it can be shown that almost every sequence (from the point of view of the standard [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] - "fair coin" or [[Lebesgue measure]] - on the space of infinite binary sequences) is random. Also, since it can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity relative to two different universal machines differs by at most a constant, the collection of random infinite sequences does not depend on the choice of universal machine (in contrast to finite strings). This definition of randomness is usually called ''Martin-Löf'' randomness, after [[Per Martin-Löf]], to distinguish it from other similar notions of randomness. It is also sometimes called ''1-randomness'' to distinguish it from other stronger notions of randomness (2-randomness, 3-randomness, etc.).

(Related definitions can be made for alphabets other than the set <math>\{0,1\}</math>.)

==Specific Sequence==

Algorithmic information theory (AIT) is the information theory of individual objects, using computer science, and concerns itself with the relationship between computation, information, and randomness.

The information content or complexity of an object can be measured by the length of its shortest description. For instance the string

<code>"0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101"</code>

has the short description "32 repetitions of '01'", while

<code>"1100100001100001110111101110110011111010010000100101011110010110"</code>

presumably has no simple description other than writing down the string itself.

More formally, the Algorithmic Complexity (AC) of a string x is defined as the length of the shortest program computes or outputs x, where the program is run on some fixed reference universal computer.

A closely related notion is the probability that a universal computer outputs some string x when fed with a program chosen at random. This Algorithmic "Solomon-off" Probability (AP) is key in addressing the old philosophical problem of induction in a formal way.

The major drawback of AC and AP are their incomputability. Time-bounded "Levin" complexity penalizes a slow program by adding the logarithm of its running time to its length. This leads to computable variants of AC and AP, and Universal "Levin" Search (US) solves all inversion problems in optimal (apart from some unrealistically large multiplicative constant) time.

AC and AP also allow a formal and rigorous definition of randomness of individual strings do not depend on physical or philosophical intuitions about non-determinism or likelihood. Roughly, a string is Algorithmic "Martin-Loef" Random (AR) if it is incompressible in the sense that its algorithmic complexity is equal to its length.

AC, AP, and AR are the core sub-disciplines of AIT, but AIT spawns into many other areas. It serves as the foundation of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, can simplify proofs in computational complexity theory, has been used to define a universal similarity metric between objects, solves the Maxwell daemon problem, and many others.

<title>Algorithmic skeleton</title>
<text>In [[computing]], '''algorithmic skeletons''' (a.k.a. Parallelism Patterns) are a high-level [[parallel programming model]] for parallel and distributed computing.

Algorithmic skeletons take advantage of common programming patterns to hide the complexity of parallel and distributed applications. Starting from a basic set of patterns (skeletons), more complex patterns can be built by combining the basic ones.

==Overview==
The most outstanding feature of algorithmic skeletons, which differentiates them from other high-level parallel programming models, is that orchestration and synchronization of the parallel activities is implicitly defined by the skeleton patterns. Programmers do not have to specify the synchronizations between the application's sequential parts. This yields two implications. First, as the communication/data access patterns are known in advance, cost models can be applied to schedule skeletons programs<ref>''K. Hammond and G. Michelson, editors.'' "Research Directions in Parallel Functional Programming." Springer-Verlag, London, UK, 1999.</ref>. Second, that algorithmic skeleton programming reduces the number of errors when compared to traditional lower-level parallel programming models (Threads, MPI).

==History==
Algorithmic skeletons were first introduced by Cole <ref name="cole_thesis">''Murray Cole.'' "Algorithmic Skeletons: structured management of parallel computation" MIT Press, Cambdridge, MA, USA, 1989</ref> in 1989. Several frameworks have been proposed by different research groups using different techniques such as functional, imperative, custom and object oriented languages. A recent survey of algorithmic skeleton frameworks can be found in <ref name="survey_2010">''Horacio González-Vélez and Mario Leyton'' "A survey of algorithmic skeleton frameworks: high-level structured parallel programming enablers" Software: Practice and Experience
Volume 40, Issue 12, pages 1135-1160, November/December 2010.

==Well-known skeleton patterns==
This section describes some well known Algorithmic Skeleton patterns. Additionally, the patterns signature in the [http://skandium.niclabs.cl Skandium] library is provided for clarity.

* '''FARM''' is also known as '''master-slave'''. Farm represents task replication where the execution of different tasks by the same farm are replicated and executed in parallel.
<source lang="java">
Farm(Skeleton &amp;lt;P,R&amp;gt; skeleton){...}
</source>
* '''PIPE''' represents staged computation. Different tasks can be computed simultaneously on different pipe stages. A pipe can have a variable number of stages, each stage of a pipe may be a nested skeleton pattern. Note that an n-stage pipe can be composed by nesting n-1 2-stage pipes.
<source lang="java">
&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; Pipe(Skeleton&amp;lt;P,X&amp;gt; stage1, Skeleton&amp;lt;P,X&amp;gt; stage2){...}
</source>
* '''FOR''' represents fixed iteration, where a task is executed a fixed number of times. In some implementations the executions may take place in parallel.
<source lang="java">
For(Skeleton&amp;lt;P,X&amp;gt; skeleton, int times){...}
</source>
* '''WHILE''' represents conditional iteration, where a given skeleton is executed until a condition is met.
<source lang="java">
public While(Skeleton&amp;lt;P,P&amp;gt; skeleton, Condition&amp;lt;&amp;gt; condition){...}
</source>
* '''IF''' represents conditional branching, where the execution choice between two skeleton patterns is decided by a condition.
<source lang="java">
If(Condition&amp;lt;P&amp;gt; condition, Skeleton&amp;lt;P,R&amp;gt;trueCase, Skeleton&amp;lt;P,R&amp;gt; falseCase){...}
</source>
* '''MAP''' represents ''split'', ''execute'', ''merge'' computation. A task is divided into sub-tasks, sub-tasks are executed in parallel according to a given skeleton, and finally sub-task's results are merged to produce the original task's result.
<source lang="java">
&amp;lt;X,Y&amp;gt; Map(Split&amp;lt;P,X&amp;gt; split, Skeleton&amp;lt;X,Y&amp;gt; skeleton, Merge&amp;lt;Y,R&amp;gt; merge){...}
</source>
* '''D&amp;C''' represents divide and conquer parallelism. A task is recursively sub-divided until a condition is met, then the sub-task is executed and results are merged while the recursion is unwound.
<source lang="java">

* '''SEQ''' does not represent parallelism, but it is often used a convenient tool to wrap code as the leafs of the skeleton nesting.
<source lang="java">
public Seq(Execute &amp;lt;P,R&amp;gt; execute){...}
</source>

==Example program==
The following example is based on the Java [http://skandium.niclabs.cl Skandium] library for parallel programming.

The objective is to implement an Algorithmic Skeleton based parallel version of the '''QuickSort''' algorithm using the Divide and Conquer pattern. Notice that the high-level approach hides Thread management from the programmer.

<source lang="java">
// 1. Define the skeleton program
Skeleton&amp;lt;Range,Range&amp;gt; sort =   new DaC&amp;lt;Range,Range&amp;gt;(
    new ShouldSplit(threshold, maxTimes),
    new SplitList(),
    new Sort(),
    new MergeList());
		
// 2. Input parameters
Future&amp;lt;Range&amp;gt; future = sort.input(new Range(generate(...)));
	
// 3. Do something else here.
// ...
	
// 4. Block for the results
Range result = future.get();
</source>

# The first thing is to define a new instance of the skeleton with the functional code that fills the pattern (ShouldSplit, SplitList, Sort, MergeList). The functional code is written by the programmer without parallelism concerns.
# The second step is the input of data which triggers the computation.  In this case Range is a class holding an array and two indexes which allow the representation of a subarray. For every data entered into the framework a new Future object is created. More than one Future can be entered into a skeleton simultaneously.
# The Future allows for asynchronous computation, as other tasks can be performed while the results are computed.
# We can retrieve the result of the computation, blocking if necessary (i.e. results not yet available).

The functional codes in this example correspond to four types Condition, Split, Execute, and Merge.

<source lang="java">
public class ShouldSplit implements Condition&amp;lt;Range&amp;gt;{

  int threshold, maxTimes, times;
  
  public ShouldSplit(int threshold, int maxTimes){
    this.threshold = threshold;
    this.maxTimes  = maxTimes;
    this.times     = 0;
  }
	
  @Override
  public synchronized boolean condition(Range r){
    return r.right - r.left &amp;gt; threshold &amp;&amp;
    	   times++ &amp;lt; this.maxTimes;
  }
}
</source>

The ShouldSplit class implements the Condition interface. The function receives an input, Range r in this case, and returning true or false. In the context of the Divide and Conquer where this function will be used, this will decide whether a sub-array should be subdivided again or not.

The SplitList class implements the split interface, which in this case divides an (sub-)array into smaller sub-arrays. The class uses a helper function <code>partition(...)</code> which implements the well known QuickSort pivot and swap scheme.

<source lang="java">
public class SplitList implements Split&amp;lt;Range,Range&amp;gt;{

 @Override
 public Range[] split(Range r){
        
    int i = partition(r.array, r.left, r.right);
        
    Range[] intervals = {new Range(r.array, r.left, i-1), 
                         new Range(r.array, i+1, r.right)};
        
    return intervals;
 }
}
</source>

The Sort class implements and Execute interface, and is in charge of sorting the sub-array specified by <code>Range r</code>. In this case we simply invoke Java's default (Arrays.sort) method for the given sub-array.

<source lang="java">
public class Sort implements Execute&amp;lt;Range,Range&amp;gt; {

  @Override
  public Range execute(Range r){
		
    if (r.right &amp;lt;= r.left) return r;
		
    Arrays.sort(r.array, r.left, r.right+1);
		
    return r;
  }
}
</source>

Finally, once a set of sub-arrays are sorted  we merge the sub-array parts into a bigger array with the MergeList class which implements a Merge interface.

<source lang="java">
public class MergeList implements Merge&amp;lt;Range,Range&amp;gt;{

  @Override
  public Range merge(Range[] r){
		
    Range result = new Range( r[0].array, r[0].left, r[1].right);
		
    return result;
  }
}
</source>

==Frameworks and libraries==
=== ASSIST ===

'''ASSIST''' <ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0167-8191(02)00188-6}}</ref><ref name="assist_CMST2006">''M. Aldinucci, M. Coppola, M. Danelutto, N. Tonellotto, M. Vanneschi, and C. Zoccolo.'' "High
level grid programming with ASSIST." Computational Methods in Science and Technology, 12(1):21–32, 2006.</ref> is a programming environment which provides programmers with a structured coordination language. The coordination language can express parallel programs as an arbitrary graph of software modules. The module graph describes how a set of modules interact with each other using a set of typed data streams. The modules can be sequential or parallel. Sequential modules can be written in C, C++, or Fortran; and parallel modules are programmed with a special ASSIST parallel module (''parmod'').

AdHoc <ref>M. Aldinucci and M. Torquati. Accelerating apache farms through ad-HOC distributed scalable object repository. In Proc. of 10th Intl. Euro-Par 2004 Parallel Processing, volume 3149 of LNCS, pages 596–605. Springer, 2004.</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-0-387-72812-4_6}}</ref>, a hierarchical and fault-tolerant Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) system is used to interconnect streams of data between processing elements by providing a repository with: get/put/remove/execute operations. Research around AdHoc has focused on transparency, scalability, and fault-tolerance of the data repository.

While not a classical skeleton framework, in the sense that no skeletons are provided, ASSIST's generic ''parmod'' can be specialized into classical skeletons such as: ''farm'', ''map'', etc.  ASSIST also supports autonomic control of ''parmods''s, and can be subject to a performance contract by dynamically adapting the number of resources used.

===CO2P3S===
'''CO2P3S''' (Correct Object-Oriented Pattern-based Parallel Programming System), is a pattern oriented development environment <ref>'S. MacDonald, J. Anvik, S. Bromling, J. Schaeffer, D. Szafron, and K. Tan.' "From patterns
 to frameworks to parallel programs." Parallel Comput., 28(12):1663–1683, 2002.</ref>, which achieves parallelism using threads in Java.

'''CO2P3S''' is concerned with the complete development process of a parallel application. Programmers interact through a programming GUI to choose a pattern and its configuration options. Then, programmers fill the hooks required for the pattern, and new code is generated as a framework in Java for the parallel execution of the application. The generated framework uses three levels, in descending order of abstraction: patterns layer, intermediate code layer, and native code layer. Thus, advanced programmers may intervene the generated code at multiple levels to tune the performance of their applications. The generated code is mostly type safe, using the types provided by the programmer which do not require extension of superclass, but fails to be completely type safe such as in the reduce(..., Object reducer) method in the mesh pattern.

The set of patterns supported in CO2P3S corresponds to method-sequence, distributor, mesh, and wavefront. Complex applications can be built by composing frameworks with their object references. Nevertheless, if no pattern is suitable, the MetaCO2P3S graphical tool addresses extensibility by allowing programmers to modify the pattern designs and introduce new patterns into CO2P3S.

Support for distributed memory architectures in CO2P3S was introduced in later <ref>''K. Tan, D. Szafron, J. Schaeffer, J. Anvik, and S. MacDonald.'' "Using generative design patterns to generate parallel code for a distributed memory environment." In PPoPP ’03: Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming, pages 203–215, New York, NY, USA, 2003. ACM.</ref>. To use a distributed memory pattern, programmers must change the pattern’s memory option from shared to distributed, and generate the new code. From the usage perspective, the distributed memory version of the code requires the management of remote exceptions.

===Calcium &amp; Skandium===
'''Calcium''' is greatly inspired by Lithium and Muskel. As such, it provides algorithmic skeleton programming as a Java library. Both task and data parallel skeletons are fully nestable; and are instantiated via parametric skeleton objects, not inheritance.

'''Calcium''' supports the execution of skeleton applications on top of the [[ProActive]] environment
for distributed cluster like infrastructure. Additionally, Calcium has three distinctive features for algorithmic skeleton programming. First, a performance tuning model which helps programmers identify code responsible for performance bugs<ref>''D. Caromel and M. Leyton.'' "Fine tuning algorithmic skeletons." In 13th International Euro-Par Conference: Parallel Processing, volume 4641 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 72–81. Springer-Verlag, 2007.</ref>. Second, a type system for nestable skeletons which is proven to guaranty subject reduction properties and is implemented using Java Generics<ref>''D. Caromel, L. Henrio, and M. Leyton.'' "Type safe algorithmic skeletons." In Proceedings of the 16th Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing, pages 45–53, Toulouse, France, Feb. 2008. IEEE CS Press.</ref>. Third, a transparent algorithmic skeleton file access model, which enables skeletons for data intensive applications<ref>''D. Caromel and M. Leyton.'' "A transparent non-invasive file data model for algorithmic skeletons." In 22nd International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS),
pages 1–8, Miami, USA, March 2008. IEEE Computer Society.</ref>.

[http://skandium.niclabs.cl Skandium] is a complete re-implementation of '''Calcium''' for multi-core computing. Programs written on '''Skandium''' may take advantage of shared memory to simplify parallel programming<ref>''Mario Leyton, Jose M. Piquer.'' "Skandium: Multi-core Programming with algorithmic skeletons", IEEE Euro-micro PDP 2010.</ref> .

===Eden===
'''Eden''' <ref>''Rita Loogen and Yolanda Ortega-Mallén and Ricardo Peña-Marí.'' "Parallel Functional Programming in Eden", Journal of Functional Programming, No. 15(2005),3, pages 431-475</ref> is a parallel programming language for distributed memory environments, which extends Haskell. Processes are defined explicitly to achieve parallel programming, while their communications remain implicit. Processes communicate through unidirectional channels, which connect one writer to exactly one reader. Programmers only need to specify which data a processes depends on. Eden’s process model provides direct control over process granularity, data distribution and communication topology.

'''Eden''' is not a skeleton language in the sense that skeletons are not provided as language constructs. Instead, skeletons are defined on top of Eden’s lower-level process abstraction, supporting both task and data parallelism. So, contrary to most other approaches, Eden lets the skeletons be defined in the same language and at the same level, the skeleton instantiation is written: Eden itself. Because Eden is an extension of a functional language, Eden skeletons are [[higher order function]]s. Eden introduces the concept of implementation skeleton, which is an architecture independent scheme that describes a parallel implementation of an algorithmic skeleton.

===eSkel===
The '''Edinburgh Skeleton Library''' ('''eSkel''') is provided in C and runs on top of MPI. The first version of eSkel was described in <ref>''Murray Cole.'' "Bringing skeletons out of the closet: a pragmatic manifesto for skeletal parallel programming." Parallel Computing, 30(3):389–406, 2004.</ref>, while a later version is presented in <ref>''A. Benoit, M. Cole, S. Gilmore, and J. Hillston.'' "Flexible skeletal programming with eskel." In J. C. Cunha and P. D. Medeiros, editors, Euro-Par, volume 3648 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 761–770. Springer, 2005.</ref>.

In <ref>''A. Benoit and M. Cole.'' "Two fundamental concepts in skeletal parallel programming." In V. Sunderam, D. van Albada, P. Sloot, and J. Dongarra, editors, The International Confer-ence on Computational Science (ICCS 2005), Part II, LNCS 3515, pages 764–771. Springer Verlag, 2005.</ref>, nesting-mode and interaction-mode for skeletons are defined. The nesting-mode can be either transient or persistent, while the interaction-mode can be either implicit or explicit. Transient nesting means that the nested skeleton is instantiated for each invocation and destroyed
Afterwards, while persistent means that the skeleton is instantiated once and the same skeleton instance will be invoked throughout the application. Implicit interaction means that the flow of data between skeletons is completely defined by the skeleton composition, while explicit means that data can be generated or removed from the flow in a way not specified by the skeleton composition. For example, a skeleton that produces an output without ever receiving an input has explicit interaction.

Performance prediction for scheduling and resource mapping, mainly for pipe-lines, has been
explored by Benoit et al.<ref>''A. Benoit, M. Cole, S. Gilmore, and J. Hillston.'' Evaluating the performance of skeleton-based high level parallel programs. In M. Bubak, D. van Albada, P. Sloot, and J. Dongarra, editors, The International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2004), Part III, LNCS 3038, pages 289–296. Springer Verlag, 2004.</ref><ref>''A. Benoit, M. Cole, S. Gilmore, and J. Hillston.'' "Evaluating the performance of pipeline structured parallel programs with skeletons and process algebra."

They provided a performance model for each mapping,
based on process algebra, and determine the best scheduling strategy based on the results of the
model.

More recent works have addressed the problem of adaptation on structured parallel programming <ref>''G. Yaikhom, M. Cole, S. Gilmore, and J. Hillston.'' "A structural approach for modelling performance of systems using skeletons." Electr. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci., 190(3):167–183,2007.</ref>, in particular for the pipe skeleton<ref>''H.

===HDC===
'''Higher-order Divide and Conquer''' ('''HDC''') <ref>''C. A. Herrmann and C. Lengauer.'' "HDC: A higher-order language for divide-and-conquer." Parallel Processing Letters, 10(2–3):239–250, 2000.</ref> is a subset of the functional language Haskell <ref>''P. Hudak, S. P. Jones, P. Wadler, B. Boutel, J. Fairbairn, J. Fasel, M. M. Guzm ́n, K. Hammond, J. Hughes, T. Johnsson, D. Kieburtz, R. Nikhil, W. Partain, and J. Peterson.'' "Report on the programming language haskell: a non-strict, purely functional language version 1.2." SIGPLAN Not., 27(5):1–164, 1992.</ref>. Functional programs are presented as polymorphic higher-order functions, which can be compiled into C/MPI, and linked with skeleton implementations. The language focus on divide and conquer paradigm, and starting from a general kind of divide and conquer skeleton, more specific cases with efficient implementations are derived. The specific cases correspond to: fixed recursion depth, constant recursion degree, multiple block recursion, elementwise operations, and
correspondent communications <ref>''C. A. Herrmann.'' The Skeleton-Based Parallelization of Divide-and-Conquer Recursions. PhD thesis, 2000. ISBN 3-89722-556-5.".</ref>

'''HDC''' pays special attention to the subproblem’s granularity and its relation with the number of
Available processors. The total number of processors is a key parameter for the performance of the
skeleton program as HDC strives to estimate an adequate assignment of processors for each part
of the program. Thus, the performance of the application is strongly related with the estimated
number of processors leading to either exceeding number of subproblems, or not enough parallelism
to exploit available processors.

===HOC-SA===
HOC-SA is an [http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Guidelines#The_Globus_Incubator Globus Incubator project].<br/>
HOC-SA stands for Higher-Order Components-Service Architecture.
Higher-Order Components ([http://pvs.uni-muenster.de/pvs/forschung/hoc HOCs]) have the aim of simplifying
Grid application development. <br/>
The objective of HOC-SA is to provide Globus users, who do not want to know about all the details of the Globus middleware (GRAM RSL documents, Web services and resource configuration etc.), with HOCs that provide a higher-level interface to the Grid than the core Globus Toolkit.<br/>
HOCs are Grid-enabled skeletons, implemented as components on top of the Globus Toolkit, remotely accessibly via Web Services<ref>''J. D&amp;uuml;nnweber, S. Gorlatch.'' "Higher-Order Components for Grid Programming.

===JaSkel===
'''JaSkel''' <ref>''J. F. Ferreira, J. L. Sobral, and A. J. Proenca.'' "Jaskel: A java skeleton-based framework
for structured cluster and grid computing". In CCGRID ’06: Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid, pages 301–304, Washington, DC, USA, 2006. IEEE Computer Society.</ref> is a Java based skeleton framework providing skeletons such as farm, pipe and heartbeat. Skeletons are specialized using inheritance. Programmers implement the abstract methods for each skeleton to provide their application specific code. Skeletons in JaSkel are provided in both sequential, concurrent and dynamic versions. For example, the concurrent farm can be used in shared memory environments (threads), but not in distributed environments (clusters) where
the distributed farm should be used. To change from one version to the other, programmers must
change their classes’ signature to inherit from a different skeleton. The nesting of skeletons uses the basic Java Object class, and therefore no type system is enforced during the skeleton composition.

The distribution aspects of the computation are handled in '''JaSkel''' using AOP, more specifically
the AspectJ implementation. Thus, '''JaSkel''' can be deployed on both cluster and Grid like
infrastructures <ref>''J. Sobral and A. Proenca.'' "Enabling jaskel skeletons for clusters and computational grids." In IEEE Cluster. IEEE Press, 9 2007.</ref>. Nevertheless, a drawback of the '''JaSkel''' approach is that the nesting of the skeleton strictly relates to the deployment infrastructure. Thus, a double nesting of farm yields a better performance than a single farm on hierarchical infrastructures. This defeats the purpose of using AOP to separate the distribution and functional concerns of the skeleton program.

Both of them provide nestable skeletons to the programmer as Java libraries.The evaluation of a skeleton application follows a formal definition of operational semantics introduced by Aldinucci and Danelutto <ref>''M. Aldinucci and M. Danelutto.'' "An operational semantics for skeletons." In G. R. Joubert, W. E. Nagel, F. J. Peters, and W. V.

The semantics describe both functional and parallel behavior of the skeleton language using a labeled transition system. Additionally, several performance optimization are applied such as: skeleton rewriting techniques [18, 10], task lookahead, and server-to-server lazy binding<ref>''M. Aldinucci, M. Danelutto, and J. D&amp;uuml;nnweber.'' "Optimization techniques for implementing parallel skeletons in grid environments." In S. Gorlatch, editor, Proc. of CMPP: Intl.

Parallel Processing Letters, 11(1):41–56, 2001.</ref><ref>M. Danelutto. "Dynamic run time support for skeletons." Technical report, 1999.</ref> to achieve parallelism. When the input stream receives a new parameter, the skeleton program is processed to obtain a macro-data flow graph. The nodes of the graph are macro-data flow instructions (MDFi) which represent the sequential pieces of code provided by the programmer. Tasks are used to group together several MDFi, and are consumed by idle processing elements from a task pool. When the computation of the graph is concluded, the result is placed into the output stream and thus delivered back to the user.

'''Muskel''' also provides non-functional features such as Quality of Service (QoS)<ref>''M. Danelutto.'' "Qos in parallel programming through application managers."

===Mallba===
'''Mallba''' <ref>''E. Alba, F. Almeida, M. J. Blesa, J. Cabeza, C. Cotta, M. Diaz, I. Dorta, J. Gabarro, C. Leon, J. Luna, L. M. Moreno, C. Pablos, J. Petit, A. Rojas, and F. Xhafa.'' "Mallba: A library of
skeletons for combinatorial optimisation (research note)." In Euro-Par ’02: Proceedings of
the 8th International Euro-Par Conference on Parallel Processing, pages 927–932, London,
UK, 2002. Springer-Verlag.</ref> is a library for combinatorial optimizations supporting exact, heuristic and hybrid search strategies<ref>E. Alba, F. Almeida, M. Blesa, C. Cotta, M. Diaz, I. Dorta, J. Gabarro, C. Leon, G. Luque, J. Petit, C. Rodriguez, A. Rojas, and F. Xhafa. Efficient parallel lan/wan algorithms for optimization: the mallba project. Parallel Computing, 32(5):415–440, 2006.</ref>. Each strategy is implemented in Mallba as a generic skeleton which can be used by prodiving the required code. On the exact search algorithms Mallba provides branch-and-bound and dynamic-optimization skeletons. For local search heuristics Mallba supports: hill climbing, metropolis, simulated annealing, and tabu search; and also population based heuristics derived from evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms, evolution strategy, and others (CHC). The hybrid skeletons combine strategies, such as: GASA, a mixture of genetic algorithm and
simulated annealing, and CHCCES which combines CHC and ES.

The skeletons are provided as a C++ library and are not nestable but type safe. A custom
MPI abstraction layer is used, NetStream, which takes care of primitive data type marshalling,
synchronization, etc. A skeleton may have multiple lower-level parallel implementations depending
on the target architectures: sequential, LAN, and WAN. For example: centralized master-slave,
distributed master-slave, etc.

'''Mallba''' also provides state variables which hold the state of the search skeleton. The state links the search with the environment, and can be accessed to inspect the evolution of the search and
decide on future actions. For example, the state can be used to store the best solution found so
far, or α, β values for branch and bound pruning <ref>''E. Alba, G. Luque, J. Garcia-Nieto, G. Ordonez, and G. Leguizamon.'' "Mallba a software library to design efficient optimisation algorithms." International Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications, 1(1):74–85, 2007.</ref>.

Compared with other frameworks, Mallba’s usage of skeletons concepts is unique. Skeletons
are provided as parametric search strategies rather than parametric parallelization patterns.

The Muenster Skeleton Library '''Muesli''' <ref>''H. Kuchen and J. Striegnitz.'' "Features from functional programming for a C++ skeleton library". Concurrency - Practice and Experience, 17(7-8):739-756, 2005.</ref><ref>''Philipp Ciechanowicz, Michael Poldner, and Herbert Kuchen.'' "The Muenster Skeleton Library Muesli - A Comprehensive Overview." ERCIS Working Paper No. 7, 2009.</ref> is a C++ template library which re-implements many of the ideas and concepts introduced in [[Algorithmic skeleton#Skil|Skil]], e.g. higher order functions, currying, and polymorphic types [http://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/pi/forschung/Skeletons/index.html]. It is build on top of [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] 1.2 and [[OpenMP]] 2.5 and supports, unlike many other skeleton libraries, both task and data parallel skeletons. Skeleton nesting (composition) is similar to the two tier approach of [[Algorithmic skeleton#P3L, SkIE, SKElib|P3L]], i.e. task parallel skeletons can be nested arbitrarily while data parallel skeletons cannot, but may be used at the leaves of a task parallel nesting tree <ref>''H. Kuchen and M. Cole''. "The integration of task and data parallel skeletons." Parallel Processing Letters, 12(2):141-155, 2002.</ref>. C++ templates are used to render skeletons polymorphic, but no type system is enforced. However, the library implements an automated serialization mechanism inspired by <ref>''A. Alexandrescu.'' "Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied". Addison-Wesley, 2001.</ref> such that, in addition to the standard MPI data types, arbitrary user-defined data types can be used within the skeletons. The supported task parallel skeletons <ref>''Michael Poldner.'' "Task Parallel Algorithmic Skeletons."

As a unique feature, Muesli’s data parallel skeletons automatically scale both on single- as well as on multi-core, multi-node cluster architectures <ref>''Philipp Ciechanowicz, Philipp Kegel, Maraike Schellmann, Sergei Gorlatch, and Herbert Kuchen.'' "Parallelizing the LM OSEM Image Reconstruction on Multi-Core Clusters." Parallel Computing: From Multicores and GPU's to Petascale, 19: 169-176, 2010.</ref><ref>''Philipp Ciechanowicz and Herbert Kuchen.'' "Enhancing Muesli's Data Parallel Skeletons for Multi-Core Computer Architectures". International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), 108-113, 2010.</ref>. Here, scalability across nodes and cores is ensured by simultaneously using MPI and OpenMP, respectively. However, this feature is optional in the sense that a program written with Muesli still compiles and runs on a single-core, multi-node cluster computer without changes to the source code, i.e. backward compatibility is guaranteed. This is ensured by providing a very thin OpenMP abstraction layer such that the support of multi-core architectures can be switched on/off by simply providing/omitting the OpenMP compiler flag when compiling the program. By doing so, virtually no overhead is introduced at runtime.

===P3L, SkIE, SKElib===
'''P3L''' <ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/cpe.4330070305}}</ref> (Pisa Parallel Programming Language) is a skeleton based coordination language. '''P3L''' provides skeleton constructs which are used to coordinate the parallel or sequential execution of C code. A compiler named Anacleto <ref>''S. Ciarpaglini, M. Danelutto, L. Folchi, C. Manconi, and S. Pelagatti.'' "ANACLETO: a template-based p3l compiler." In Proceedings of the Seventh Parallel Computing Workshop (PCW ’97), Australian National University, Canberra, August 1997.</ref> is provided for the language. Anacleto uses implementation templates to compile P3 L code into a target architecture. Thus, a skeleton can have several templates each optimized for a different architecture. A template implements a skeleton on a specific architecture and provides a parametric process graph with a performance model. The performance model can then be used to decide program transformations which can lead to performance optimizations <ref>M. Aldinucci, M. Coppola, and M. Danelutto. Rewriting skeleton programs: How to evaluate the data-parallel stream-parallel tradeoff. In S. Gorlatch, editor, Proc of CMPP: Intl. Workshop on Constructive Methods for Parallel Programming, pages 44–58. Uni. Passau, Germany, May 1998.</ref>.

A '''P3L''' module corresponds to a properly defined skeleton construct with input and output
streams, and other sub-modules or sequential C code. Modules can be nested using the two tier
model, where the outer level is composed of task parallel skeletons, while data parallel skeletons
may be used in the inner level [64]. Type verification is performed at the data flow level, when the programmer explicitly specifies the type of the input and output streams, and by specifying the
flow of data between sub-modules.

'''SkIE''' <ref>''B. Bacci, M. Danelutto, S. Pelagatti, and M. Vanneschi.'' "Skie: a heterogeneous environment
for HPC applications." Parallel Comput., 25(13-14):1827–1852, 1999.</ref> (Skeleton-based Integrated Environment) is quite similar to '''P3L''', as it is also based on a coordination language, but provides advanced features such as debugging tools, performance analysis, visualization and graphical
user interface. Instead of directly using the coordination language, programmers interact with a
graphical tool, where parallel modules based on skeletons can be composed.

'''SKELib''' <ref>''M. Danelutto and M. Stigliani.'' "Skelib: Parallel programming with skeletons in C." In Euro-Par ’00: Proceedings from the 6th International Euro-Par Conference on Parallel Processing, pages 1175–1184, London, UK, 2000. Springer-Verlag.</ref> builds upon the contributions of '''P3L''' and '''SkIE''' by inheriting, among others, the template system. It differs from them because a coordination language is no longer used, but instead skeletons are provided as a library in C, with performance similar as the one achieved in '''P3L'''. Contrary to '''Skil''', another C like skeleton framework, type safety is not addressed in '''SKELib'''.

===PAS and EPAS===
'''PAS''' (Parallel Architectural Skeletons) is a framework for skeleton programming developed in C++
and MPI <ref>''D. Goswami, A. Singh, and B. R. Preiss.'' "From desgign patterns to parallel architectural
skeletons." J. Parallel Distrib. Comput., 62(4):669–695, 2002.</ref><ref>''D. Goswami, A. Singh, and B. R. Preiss.'' "Using object-oriented techniques for realizing parallel architectural skeletons." In ISCOPE ’99: Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Computing in Object-Oriented Parallel Environments, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 130–141, London, UK, 1999. Springer-Verlag.</ref>. Programmers use an extension of C++ to write their skeleton applications1 . The code is then passed through a Perl script which expands the code to pure C++ where skeletons are specialized through inheritance.

In '''PAS''', every skeleton has a Representative (Rep) object which must be provided by the
programmer and is in charge of coordinating the skeleton’s execution. Skeletons can be nested in
a hierarchical fashion via the Rep objects. Besides the skeleton’s execution, the Rep also explicitly
manages the reception of data from the higher level skeleton, and the sending of data to the sub-skeletons. A parametrized communication/synchronization protocol is used to send and receive
data between parent and sub-skeletons.

An extension of PAS labeled as '''SuperPas''' <ref>''M. M. Akon, D. Goswami, and H. F. Li.'' "Superpas: A parallel architectural skeleton model supporting extensibility and skeleton composition." In Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications Second International Symposium, ISPA, Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
pages 985–996. Springer-Verlag, 2004.</ref> and later as '''EPAS''' <ref>''M. M. Akon, A. Singh, D. Goswami, and H. F. Li.'' "Extensible parallel architectural skeletons." In High Performance Computing HiPC 2005, 12th International Conference, volume 3769 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 290–301, Goa, India, December 2005. Springer-Verlag.</ref> addresses skeleton extensibility concerns. With the '''EPAS''' tool, new skeletons can be added to '''PAS'''. A Skeleton Description Language (SDL) is used to describe the skeleton pattern by specifying the topology with respect to a virtual processor grid. The SDL can then be compiled into native C++ code, which can be used as any other skeleton.

===SBASCO===
'''SBASCO''' ('''Skeleton-BAsed Scientific COmponents''') is a programming environment oriented towards efficient development of parallel and distributed numerical applications <ref>''M. Diaz, B. Rubio, E. Soler, and J. M. Troya.'' "SBASCO: Skeleton-based scientific components."  In PDP, pages 318–. IEEE Computer Society, 2004.</ref>. '''SBASCO''' aims at integrating two programming models: skeletons and components with a custom composition language. An application view of a component provides a description of its interfaces (input and
output type); while a configuration view provides, in addition, a description of the component’s
internal structure and processor layout. A component’s internal structure can be defined using
three skeletons: farm, pipe and multi-block.

'''SBASCO'''’s addresses domain decomposable applications through its multi-block skeleton. Domains are specified through arrays (mainly two dimensional), which are decomposed into sub-arrays with possible overlapping boundaries. The computation then takes place in an iterative BSP like fashion. The first stage consists of local computations, while the second stage performs boundary exchanges. A use case is presented for a reaction-diffusion problem in <ref>M. Diaz, S. Romero, B. Rubio, E. Soler, and J. M. Troya. "Using SBASCO to solve reaction-diffusion equations in two-dimensional irregular domains." In Practical Aspects of High-Level
Parallel Programming (PAPP), affiliated to the International Conference on Computational
Science (ICCS), volume 3992 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 912–919. Springer,
2006.</ref>.

Two type of components are presented in <ref>''M. Diaz, S. Romero, B. Rubio, E. Soler, and J. M. Troya.'' "An aspect oriented framework for scientific component development." In PDP ’05: Proceedings of the 13th Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing, pages 290–296, Washington, DC, USA, 2005. IEEE Computer Society.</ref>. Scientific Components (SC) which provide the functional code; and Communication Aspect Components (CAC) which encapsulate non-functional behavior such as communication, distribution processor layout and replication. For example, SC components are connected to a CAC component which can act as a manager at runtime by dynamically re-mapping processors assigned to a SC. A use case showing improved performance when using CAC components is shown in <ref>''M. Diaz, S. Romero, B. Rubio, E. Soler, and J. M. Troya.'' "Dynamic reconfiguration of scientific components using aspect oriented programming: A case study." In R. Meersman
And Z. Tari, editors, On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2006: CoopIS, DOA, GADA, and ODBASE, volume 4276 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 1351–1360. Springer-Verlag, 2006.</ref>.

===SCL===
The '''Structured Coordination Language''' ('''SCL''') was one of the first languages introduced for skeleton programming <ref>''J. Darlington, A. J. Field, P. G. Harrison, P. H. J. Kelly, D. W. N. Sharp, and Q. Wu.'' "Parallel programming using skeleton functions." In PARLE ’93: Proceedings of the 5th International
PARLE Conference on Parallel Architectures and Languages Europe, pages 146–160, London,
UK, 1993. Springer-Verlag</ref><ref>''J. Darlington, Y. Guo, H. W. To, and J. Yang.'' "Functional skeletons for parallel coordination." In Euro-Par ’95: Proceedings of the First International Euro-Par Conference on Parallel Processing, pages 55–66, London, UK, 1995. Springer-Verlag.</ref>.<ref>''J. Darlington, Y. ke Guo, H. W. To, and J. Yang.'' "Parallel skeletons for structured composition." In PPOPP ’95: Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming, pages 19–28, New York, NY, USA, 1995. ACM.</ref> SCL is considered a base language, and was designed to be integrated with a host language, for example Fortran. In '''SCL''', skeletons are classified into three types: '''configuration''', '''elementary''' and '''computation'''. Configuration skeletons abstract patterns for commonly used data structures such as distributed arrays (ParArray). Elementary skeletons correspond to data parallel skeletons such as map, scan, and fold. Computation skeletons which abstract the control flow and correspond mainly to task parallel skeletons such as farm, SPMD, and iterateUntil.

===SKiPPER &amp; QUAFF===
'''SKiPPER''' is a domain specific skeleton library for vision applications <ref>''J. Serot, D. Ginhac, and J. Derutin.'' "SKiPPER: a skeleton-based parallel programming environment for real-time image processing applications." In V. Malyshkin, editor, 5th International Conference on Parallel Computing Technologies (PaCT-99), volume 1662 of LNCS,pages 296–305. Springer, 6–10 September 1999.</ref>  which provides skeletons in CAML, and thus relies on CAML for type safety. Skeletons are presented in two ways: declarative and operational. Declarative skeletons are directly used by programmers, while their operational versions provide an architecture specific target implementation. From the
runtime environment, CAML skeleton specifications, and application specific functions (provided in C by the programmer), new C code is generated and compiled to run the application on the target architecture. One of the interesting things about '''SKiPPER''' is that the skeleton program can be executed sequentially for debugging.

Different approaches have been explored in '''SKiPPER''' for writing operational skeletons: static
data-flow graphs, parametric process networks, hierarchical task graphs, and tagged-token data-
flow graphs <ref>''J. Serot and D. Ginhac.'' "Skeletons for parallel image processing : an overview of the SKiPPER project". Parallel Computing, 28(12):1785–1808, Dec 2002.</ref>.

'''QUAFF''' <ref>''J. Falcou, J. Serot, T. Chateau, and J. T. Lapreste.'' "Quaff: efficient c++ design for parallel skeletons." Parallel Computing, 32(7):604–615, 2006.</ref> is a more recent skeleton library written in C++ and MPI. QUAFF relies on template-based meta-programming techniques to reduce runtime overheads and perform skeleton expansions and optimizations at compilation time. Skeletons can be nested and sequential functions are stateful. Besides type checking, QUAFF takes advantage of C++ templates to generate, at
compilation time, new C/MPI code. QUAFF is based on the CSP-model, where the skeleton program is described as a process network and production rules (single, serial, par, join) <ref>''J. Falcou and J. Serot.'' "Formal semantics applied to the implementation of a skeleton-based parallel programming library." In G. R. Joubert, C. Bischof, F. J. Peters, T. Lippert, M. Bcker, P. Gibbon, and B. Mohr, editors, Parallel Computing: Architectures, Algorithms and Applications (Proc. of PARCO 2007, Julich, Germany), volume 38 of NIC, pages 243–252, Germany, September 2007. John von Neumann Institute for Computing.</ref>.

===SkeTo===
The '''SkeTo''' <ref>''K. Matsuzaki, H. Iwasaki, K. Emoto, and Z. Hu.'' "A library of constructive skeletons for
sequential style of parallel programming." In InfoScale ’06: Proceedings of the 1st international
conference on Scalable information systems, page 13, New York, NY, USA, 2006. ACM.</ref> project is a C++ library which achieves parallelization using MPI. SkeTo is different to other skeleton libraries because instead of providing nestable parallelism patterns, SkeTo provides parallel skeletons for parallel data structures such as: lists, trees <ref>''K. Matsuzaki, Z. Hu, and M. Takeichi.'' "Parallelization with tree skeletons." In Euro-Par, volume 2790 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 789–798. Springer, 2003.</ref><ref>''K. Matsuzaki, Z. Hu, and M. Takeichi.'' "Parallel skeletons for manipulating general trees."
Parallel Comput., 32(7):590–603, 2006.</ref>, and matrices <ref>''K. Emoto, Z. Hu, K. Kakehi, and M. Takeichi.'' "A compositional framework for developing parallel programs on two dimensional arrays." Technical report, Department of Mathematical Informatics, University of Tokyo, 2005.</ref>. The data structures are typed using templates, and several parallel operations can be invoked on them. For example the list structure provides parallel operations such as: map, reduce, scan, zip, shift, etc...

Additional research around SkeTo has also focused on optimizations strategies by transforma-
tion, and more recently domain specific optimizations <ref>''K. Emoto, K. Matsuzaki, Z. Hu, and M. Takeichi.'' "Domain-specific optimization strategy for skeleton programs." In Euro-Par, volume 4641 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 705–714. Springer, 2007.</ref>. For example, '''SkeTo''' provides a fusion transformation <ref>''K. Matsuzaki, K. Kakehi, H. Iwasaki, Z. Hu, and Y. Akashi.'' "A fusion-embedded skeleton
library." In M. Danelutto, M. Vanneschi, and D. Laforenza, editors, Euro-Par, volume 3149 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 644–653. Springer, 2004.</ref> which merges two successive function invocations into a single one, thus decreasing the function call overheads and avoiding the creation of intermediate data structures
passed between functions.

===Skil===
'''Skil''' <ref>''G. H. Botorog and H. Kuchen.'' "Efficient high-level parallel programming." Theor. Comput.
Sci., 196(1-2):71–107, 1998.</ref> is an imperative language for skeleton programming. Skeletons are not
directly part of the language but are implemented with it. '''Skil''' uses a subset of C language which provides functional language like features such as higher order functions, curring and polymorphic types. When '''Skil''' is compiled, such features are eliminated and a regular C code is produced. Thus, '''Skil''' transforms polymorphic high order functions into monomorphic first order C functions. '''Skil''' does not support nestable composition of skeletons. Data parallelism is achieved using specific data parallel structures, for example to spread arrays among available processors. Filter skeletons can be used.

==Frameworks comparison==
* '''Activity Years''' is the known activity years span. The dates represented in this column correspond to the first and last publication date of a related article in a scientific journal or conference proceeding. Note that a project may still be active beyond the activity span, and that we have failed to find a publication for it beyond the given date.
* '''Programming Language''' is the interface with which programmers interact to code their skeleton applications. These languages are diverse, encompassing paradigms such as: functional languages, coordination languages, markup languages, imperative languages, object oriented languages, and even graphical user interfaces. Inside the programming language, skeletons have been provided either as language constructs or libraries. Providing skeletons as language construct implies the development of a custom domain specific language and its compiler. This was clearly the stronger trend at the begging of skeleton research. The more recent trend is to provide skeletons as libraries, in particular with object oriented languages such as C++ and Java.

* '''Execution Language''' is the language in which the skeleton applications are run or compiled. It was recognized very early that the programming languages (specially in the functional cases), were not efficient enough to execute the skeleton programs. Therefore, skeleton programming languages were simplified by executing skeleton application on other languages. Transformation processes were introduced to convert the skeleton applications (defined in the programming language) into an equivalent application on the target execution language. Different transformation processes were introduced, such as code generation or instantiation of lowerlevel skeletons (sometimes called operational skeletons) which were capable of interacting with a library in the execution language. The transformed application also gave the opportunity to introduce target architecture code, customized for performance, into the transformed application. Table 1 shows that a favorite for execution language has been the C language.

* '''Distribution Library''' provides the functionality to achieve parallel/distributed computations. The big favorite in this sense has been MPI, which is not surprising since it integrates well with the C language, and is probably the most used tool for parallelism in cluster computing. The dangers of directly programming with the distribution library are, of course, safely hidden away from the programmers who never interact with the distribution library. Recently, the trend has been to develop skeleton frameworks capable of interacting with more than one distribution library. For example, CO2 P3 S can use Threads, RMI or Sockets; Mallba can use Netstream or MPI; or JaSkel which uses AspectJ to execute the skeleton applications on different skeleton frameworks.

* '''Type Safety''' refers to the capability of detecting type incompatibility errors in skeleton program. Since the first skeleton frameworks were built on functional languages such as Haskell, type safety was simply inherited from the host language. Nevertheless, as custom languages were developed for skeleton programming, compilers had to be written to take type checking into consideration; which was not as difficult as skeleton nesting was not fully supported. Recently however, as we begun to host skeleton frameworks on object oriented languages with full nesting, the type safety issue has resurfaced. Unfortunately, type checking has been mostly overlooked (with the exception of QUAFF), and specially in Java based skeleton frameworks.

* '''Skeleton Nesting''' is the capability of hierarchical composition of skeleton patterns. Skeleton Nesting was identified as an important feature in skeleton programming from the very beginning, because it allows the composition of more complex patterns starting from a basic set of simpler patterns. Nevertheless, it has taken the community a long time to fully support arbitrary nesting of skeletons, mainly because of the scheduling and type verification difficulties. The trend is clear that recent skeleton frameworks support full nesting of skeletons.

* '''File Access''' is the capability to access and manipulate files from an application. In the past, skeleton programming has proven useful mostly for computational intensive applications, where small amounts of data require big amounts of computation time. Nevertheless, many distributed applications require or produce large amounts of data during their computation. This is the case for astrophysics, particle physics, bio-informatics, etc. Thus, providing file transfer support that integrates with skeleton programming is a key concern which has been mostly overlooked.

* '''Skeleton Set''' is the list of supported skeleton patterns. Skeleton sets vary greatly from one framework to the other, and more shocking, some skeletons with the same name have different semantics on different frameworks. The most common skeleton patterns in the literature are probably farm, pipe, and map.

<title>Alias (command)</title>
<text>{{Lowercase}}
{{unref|date=August 2010}}
In computing, '''alias''' is a [[Command (computing)|command]] in various [[command line interpreter]]s ([[Shell (computing)|shells]]) such as [[Unix shell]]s, [[4DOS]]/[[4NT]] and [[Windows PowerShell]], which enables a replacement of a word with another string. It is mainly used for abbreviating a system command, or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command. 

An alias will last for the life of the shell session. Regularly used aliases can be set from the shell's configuration file (''~/.cshrc'' or the systemwide ''/etc/csh.cshrc'' for csh, or ''~/.bashrc'' or the systemwide ''/etc/bashrc'' or ''/etc/bash.bashrc'' for bash) so that they will be available upon the start of the corresponding shell session. The alias commands may either be written in the config file directly or [[source (command)|source]]d from a  separate file, typically named .alias (or .alias-bash, .alias-csh, etc., if  multiple shells  may be used).

==Creating aliases==

Aliases can be created by supplying name/value pairs as arguments for the alias command. An example of the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] shell syntax is:

 alias copy="cp"

The corresponding syntax in the [[C shell]] or [[tcsh]] shell is:

 alias copy "cp"

This alias means that when the command <code>copy</code> is read in the shell, it will be replaced with <code>cp</code> and that command will be executed instead.

In the 4DOS/4NT shell the following syntax is used to define <code>cp</code> as an alias for the 4DOS <code>copy</code> command:

 alias cp copy

To create a new alias in Windows PowerShell, the <code>new</code> verb can be used with the <code>alias</code> cmdlet:

 new-alias ci copy-item

This creates a new alias called <code>ci</code> that will be replaced with the <code>copy-item</code> cmdlet when executed.

==History==

In Unix, aliases were introduced in the [[C shell]] and thus survive in descendent shells such as [[tcsh]] and [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]].  C shell aliases were strictly limited to one line in a shell language where all complex constructs required more, but still useful for creating simple shortcut commands.  Aliases were absent from the [[Bourne shell]], which had the more powerful facility of functions.  The alias concept was imported into [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bourne Again Shell]] (bash) and the [[Korn shell]] (ksh). Shells such as these, that support both functions and aliases, recommend using functions where possible. Cases where aliases are necessary include the use of chained aliases (bash and ksh).

==Viewing currently defined aliases==

To view defined aliases the following commands can be used:

 alias          # Used without arguments; displays a list of all current aliases
 alias -p       # Analogous to the above; not available in 4DOS/4NT and PowerShell
 alias ''myAlias''  # Displays the command for a defined alias

==Overriding aliases==

In Unix shells, if an alias exists for a command, it is possible to override the alias by surrounding the command with quotes or prefixing it with a backslash. For example, consider the following alias definition:

 alias ls='ls -la'

To override this alias and execute the <code>ls</code> command as it was originally defined, the following syntax can be used:

 'ls'

or

 \ls

In the 4DOS/4NT shell it is possible to override an alias by prefixing it with an asterisk.  For example, consider the following alias definition:

 alias dir = *dir /2/p

The asterisk in the 2nd instance of <code>dir</code> causes the unaliased <code>dir</code> to be invoked, preventing recursive alias expansion. Also the user can get the unaliased behaviour of <code>dir</code> at the command line by using the same syntax:

 *dir

==Changing aliases==

In Windows PowerShell, the <code>set</code> verb can be used with the <code>alias</code> cmdlet to change an existing alias:

 set-alias ci cls

The alias <code>ci</code> will now point to the <code>cls</code> command.

In the 4DOS/4NT shell, the <code>eset</code> command provides an interactive command line to edit an existing alias:

 eset /a cp

The <code>/a</code> causes the alias <code>cp</code> to be edited, as opposed to an environment variable of the same name.

==Removing aliases==

In Unix shells and 4DOS/4NT, aliases can be removed by executing the <code>unalias</code> command:

 unalias copy          # Removes the copy alias
 unalias -a            # The -a switch will remove all aliases; not available in 4DOS/4NT
 unalias *             # 4DOS/4NT equivalent of `unalias -a` - wildcards are supported

In Windows PowerShell, the alias can be removed from the alias:\ drive using <code>remove-item</code>:

 remove-item alias:ci  # Removes the ci alias

==Features==
===Chaining===

An alias usually replaces just the first word.  But some shells, such as <tt>bash</tt> and <tt>ksh</tt> allow a sequence or words to be replaced; this particular feature is unavailable through the function mechanism.

The usual syntax is to define the first alias with a trailing space character. For instance, using the two aliases:

 alias list='ls '      # note the trailing space to trigger chaining
 alias long='-Flas'    # options to ls for a long listing

allows:

 list long myfile      # becomes <tt>ls -Flas myfile</tt> when run

for a long listing, where "long" is also checked for being an alias.

===Quoting quotes===

To define an alias with single quotes, which itself needs to contain single quotes, you need to use several concatenated quoted strings. For example, to define an alias which would do:

<pre>perl -pe 's/^(.*) foo/$1 bar/;'</pre>

You cannot do

<pre>alias foo2bar='perl -pe \'s/^(.*) foo/$1 bar/;\'' # WRONG: backslashes do not escape the next character inside single quotes</pre>

But you can use single quotes quoted inside double quotes

<pre>alias foo2bar='perl -pe '"'"'s/^(.*) foo/$1 bar/;'"'"'</pre>

See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1250079/bash-escaping-single-quotes-inside-of-single-quoted-strings#1250279 this explanation].

You may also consider using a function instead of an alias.

==Typical aliases==

Some commonly used, but deprecated, aliases in the Bash shell:

 alias ls='ls --color=auto' # use colors
 alias la='ls -Fa'          # list all files
 alias ll='ls -Fls'         # long listing format
 
 alias rm='rm -i'           # prompt before overwrite (but dangerous, see [[Rm_(Unix)|Rm]] for a better approach)
 alias cp='cp -i'           # prompt before overwrite (same general problem as the rm)
 alias mv='mv -i'           # prompt before overwrite (same general problem as the rm)
 
 alias vi='vim'             # use improved vi editor

Standard aliases of Windows PowerShell include:

 new-alias cd set-location
 
 new-alias ls get-childitem
 new-alias dir get-childitem
 
 new-alias echo write-output
 new-alias ps get-process
 new-alias kill stop-process

==Alternatives==

Aliases should usually be kept simple. Where it would not be simple, the recommendation is usually to use one of the following:

* [[Shell script]]s, which essentially provide the full ability to create new system commands.

* [[Symbolic link]]s, either in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> if for all users, or in a users <tt>$HOME/bin</tt>    directory if for personal use.  This method is useful for providing an additional way of calling the command, and in some cases may allow access to a buried command function for the small number of commands that use their invocation name to select the mode of operation.

* [[Shell function]]s, especially if the command being created needs to modify the internal runtime environment of the shell itself (such as environment variables), needs to change the shell's current working directory, or must be implemented in a way which guarantees they it appear in the command search path for anything but an interactive shell (especially any "safer" version of <tt>rm</tt>, <tt>cp</tt>, <tt>mv</tt> and so forth).

The most common form of aliases, which just add a few options to a command and then include the rest of the command line, can be converted easily to shell functions following this pattern:

 alias ll='ls -Flas'              # long listing, alias
 ll () { ls -Flas "$@" ; }        # long listing, function

To make <tt>ls</tt> itself a function (note that "command ls" is Bash-specific, and that older Bourne shells would have used "/bin/ls" instead):

 ls () { command ls --color=auto "$@" ; }

<title>Alias analysis</title>
<text>{{No footnotes|article|date=April 2009}}
'''Alias analysis''' is a technique in [[compiler theory]], used to determine if a storage location may be accessed in more than one way. Two pointers are said to be [[Aliasing (computing)|aliased]] if they point to the same location. 

Alias analysis techniques are usually classified by flow-sensitivity and context-sensitivity. They may determine may-alias or must-alias information. The term '''alias analysis''' is often used interchangeably with term [[Pointer analysis|points-to analysis]], a specific case.

==What Does Alias Analysis Do?==

In general, alias analysis determines whether or not separate memory references point to the same area of memory.  This allows the compiler to determine what variables in the program will be affected by a statement. For example, consider the following section of code that accesses members of structures:

<code>
...;
p.foo = 1;
q.foo = 2;
i = p.foo + 3;
...
</code>

There are three possible alias cases here: 
#The variables p and q cannot alias.
#The variables p and q must alias.
#It cannot be conclusively determined at compile time if p and q alias or not. 

If p and q cannot alias, then <code>i = p.foo + 3;</code> can be changed to <code>i = 4</code>. If p and q must alias, then <code>i = p.foo + 3;</code> can be changed to <code>i = 5</code>. In both cases, we are able to perform optimizations from the alias knowledge. On the other hand, if it is not known if p and q alias or not, then no optimizations can be performed and the whole of the code must be executed to get the result. Two memory references are said to have a ''may-alias'' relation if their aliasing is unknown.

==Performing Alias Analysis==

In alias analysis, we divide the program's memory into ''alias classes''. Alias classes are disjoint sets of locations that cannot alias to one another. For the discussion here, it is assumed that the optimizations done here occur on a low-level [[Intermediate language|intermediate representation]] of the program. This is to say that the program has been compiled into binary operations, jumps, moves between registers, moves from registers to memory, moves from memory to registers, branches,  and function calls/returns.

===Type Based Alias Analysis===
If the language being compiled is [[type safe]], the compiler's type checker is correct, and the language lacks the ability to create pointers referencing local variables, (such as ML, Haskell, or Java) then some useful optimizations can be made. There are many cases where we know that two memory locations must be in different alias classes:

#Two variables of different types cannot be in the same alias class since it is a property of strongly typed, memory reference-free (i.e. references to memory locations cannot be changed directly) languages that two variables of different types cannot share the same memory location simultaneously. 
#Allocations local to the current stack frame cannot be in the same alias class as any previous allocation from another stack frame. This is the case because new memory allocations must be disjoint from all other memory allocations.
#Each record field of each record type has its own alias class, in general, because the typing discipline usually only allows for records of the same type to alias. Since all records of a type will be stored in an identical format in memory, a field can only alias to itself.
#Similarly, each array of a given type has its own alias class.

When performing alias analysis for code, every load and store to memory needs to be labeled with its class. We then have the useful property, given memory locations <math>A_i</math> and <math>B_j</math> with <math>i,j</math> alias classes, that if <math>i=j</math> then <math>A_i</math> may-alias <math>B_j</math>, and if <math>i \neq j</math> then the memory locations will not alias.

===Flow Based Alias Analysis===
Analysis based on flow, unlike type based analysis, can be applied to programs in a language with references or type-casting. Flow based analysis can be used in lieu of or to supplement type based analysis. In flow based analysis, new alias classes are created for each memory allocation, and for every global and local variable whose address has been used. References may point to more than one value over time and thus may be in more than one alias class. This means that each memory location has a set of alias classes instead of a single alias class.

<title>Alice and Bob</title>
<text>The names '''Alice and Bob''' are commonly used [[placeholder name]]s for archetypal characters in  fields such as [[cryptography]] and [[physics]]. The names are used for convenience; for example, "Alice sends a message to Bob encrypted with his public key" is easier to follow than "Party A sends a message to Party B encrypted by Party B's public key." Following the alphabet, the specific names have evolved into common parlance within these fields—helping technical topics to be explained in a more understandable fashion. 

In [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]], there are a number of widely used names for the participants in discussions and presentations about various [[protocol (cryptography)|protocols]]. The names are conventional, somewhat self-suggestive, sometimes humorous, and effectively act as [[metasyntactic variable]]s. 

In typical implementations of these protocols, it is understood that the actions attributed to characters such as Alice or Bob need not always be carried out by human parties directly, but also by a trusted automated agent (such as a computer program) on their behalf.  Despite the advantage of Alice and Bob's distinct genders in reducing ambiguity, there has been little tendency to introduce inanimate parties so they could be referred by neuter pronouns.

==List of characters==
[[File:Public key shared secret.svg|thumb|right|An example of an "Alice and Bob" analogy used in cryptography.]]
[[File:Asymetric cryptography - step 2.svg|thumb|right|Alice and Bob diagram used to explain [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hashing]].]]
This list is drawn mostly from the book ''Applied Cryptography'' by [[Bruce Schneier]].  Alice and Bob are archetypes in cryptography; Eve is also common.  Names further down the alphabet are less common.

* '''Alice''' and '''Bob'''. Generally, Alice wants to send a message to Bob. These names were used by [[Ron Rivest]] in the 1978 ''Communications of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'' article presenting the [[RSA]] cryptosystem, and in ''A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems'' published April 4, 1977, revised September 1, 1977 as technical Memo LCS/TM82. Rivest denies that these names have any relation to the 1969 movie ''[[Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice]]'' as occasionally suggested by others.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}
* '''Carol''', '''Carlos''' or '''Charlie''', as a third participant in communications.
* '''Chuck''', as a third participant usually of malicious intent.<ref>{{citation |last=Tanenbaum|first=Andrew S. | title=Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms | isbn=9780132392273 | publisher=[http://www.prenhall.com Pearson Prentice Hall] | year=2007 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=DL8ZAQAAIAAJ | page=171;399&amp;ndash;402 }}</ref>
* '''Dave''', a fourth participant, and so on alphabetically.
* {{Anchor|Eve}}'''Eve''', an ''eavesdropper'', is usually a passive attacker. While she can listen in on messages between Alice and Bob, she cannot modify them. In [[quantum cryptography]], Eve may also represent the ''environment''.
* '''Fran''', for [[Fran Allen]], Turing award winner
* '''Gordon''', a [[government]] agent.
* '''Isaac''', an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP).
* '''Ivan''', an ''issuer'' (as in financial cryptography).
* '''Justin''', or '''Julian''' from the ''justice'' system.
* {{Anchor|Mallory}}'''Mallory''', a ''malicious attacker''; unlike Eve, Mallory can modify messages, substitute her own messages, replay old messages, and so on. The problem of securing a system against Mallory is much greater than against Eve. The names '''Marvin''', '''Mallet''', and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] can also be used for this role.
* {{Anchor|Matilda}}'''Matilda''', a ''merchant'' (as in e-commerce or financial cryptography).
* '''Oscar''', an ''[[Adversary (cryptography)|opponent]]'', is usually taken as equivalent to Mallory.
* '''Pat''' or '''Peggy''', a ''prover'', and '''Victor''', a ''verifier'', often must interact in some way to show that the intended transaction has actually taken place.  They are often found in [[zero-knowledge proof]]s. Another name pair sometimes used is '''Pat''' and '''Vanna''' (after the [[Pat Sajak|host]] and [[Vanna White|hostess]] on the ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' television show).
* '''Plod''', a law enforcement officer from the children's fictional character [[Mr. Plod]], in the ''[[Noddy (character)|Noddy]]'' books by [[Enid Blyton]].
* '''Steve''', sometimes used in reference to [[Steganography]].
* '''Trent''', a ''trusted arbitrator'', is some kind of [[Trusted Third Party|neutral third party]], whose exact role varies with the protocol under discussion.
* '''Trudy''', an intruder: another alternative to Mallory.
* '''Vanna''' or '''Victor''': see '''Pat''' or '''Peggy''' above
* '''Walter''', a ''[[Prison warden|warden]]'', may be needed to guard Alice and Bob in some respect, depending on the protocol being discussed.
* '''Zoe''', often the last party to be involved in a [[cryptographic protocol]].

Although an [[interactive proof system]] is not quite a cryptographic protocol, it is sufficiently related to mention the cast of characters its literature features:
* '''Arthur''' and '''Merlin''': In interactive proof systems, the prover has unbounded computational ability and is hence associated with [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], the powerful [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. He claims the truth of a statement, and [[King Arthur|Arthur]], the wise king, questions him to verify the claim. These two characters also give the name for two [[complexity class]]es, namely [[MA (complexity)|MA]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]].

A similar pair of characters is '''Paul''' and '''Carole'''. The characters were introduced in the solution of the [[Twenty Questions]] problem,<ref>{{citation |last1=Spencer|first1=Joel|author1-link=Joel Spencer | last2=Winkler|first2=Peter|author2-link=Peter Winkler | title=Three Thresholds for a Liar | url=http://math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/papers/3thresh.ps | journal=Combinatorics, Probability and Computing | year=1992 | volume=1 | pages=81–93}}</ref> where "Paul", who asked questions, stood for [[Paul Erdős]] and "Carole", who answered them, was an [[anagram]] of "oracle". They were further used in certain [[Combinatorial game theory|combinatorial games]] in the roles of Pusher and Chooser respectively, and have since been used in various roles.<ref>{{citation |last=Muthukrishnan|first=S. | title=Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications | isbn=9781933019147 | publisher=[http://books.google.com/books?id=415loiMd_c0C&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22paul+and+carole%22 Now Publishers] | year=2005 | url=http://algo.research.googlepages.com/eight.ps | page=3}}</ref>

<title>Allan Alcorn</title>
<text>{{citations missing|article|date=June 2008}}
[[Image:AlAlcorn.jpg|thumb|Al Alcorn in 2007]]
'''Allan Alcorn''' is a pioneering [[electrical engineer|engineer]] and [[computer science|computer scientist]]. He grew up in [[San Francisco, California]], and attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[EECS|Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences]] in 1971.

== Work with Nolan Bushnell ==
He worked for the video pioneering company [[Ampex]], where he met [[Ted Dabney]] and several other people that would end up being constants through the [[Atari, Inc]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Cyan Engineering and [[Pizza Time Theater]] companies.

Alcorn was the designer of the [[video arcade]] game ''[[Pong]]'', creating it under the direction of [[Nolan Bushnell|Bushnell]] and Dabney.  Pong was a hit in the 1970s.

In addition to direct involvement with all the breakout Atari products, such as the [[Atari 2600]], Alcorn was involved at some of the historic meetings of [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]] (at that time an Atari employee) presenting their [[Apple I]] prototype.

==After Atari==
After Alcorn left Atari in 1981, he consulted to many fledging companies in [[Silicon Valley]], especially involved in the startups of [[Catalyst Technologies]], one of the first technology company incubators, created by Nolan Bushnell and other ex-Atari leaders.

Alcorn was involved in several of the startups directly, including [[Cumma (game system)|Cumma]], a re-programmable video game cartridge/kiosk system (and precursor to the similar [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] system), and an advisor to [[Etak]], one of the first practical, [[in-car navigation]] systems.

Alcorn later became an Apple Fellow, and led and consulted to a variety of startups during the tech boom.

In 1998, Alcorn co-founded [[Zowie Intertainment]], a spinoff from [[Interval Research]]. There he developed a child's [[playset]] with a location system that allowed a [[personal computer|PC]] to respond to the child's play.

'''Allan Wipper Wells''' <small>[[MBE]]</small> (born 3 May 1952) is a former [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[athletics (sport)|athlete]], who became [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Champion in the [[100 metres]] at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0026/</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Edinburgh]], Wells was educated at [[Liberton High School]]. Wells, initially a [[triple jump]]er and [[long jump]]er and crowned Scottish indoor [[Long Jump]] champion in 1974, began concentrating on [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] events in 1976. In 1977 he won the [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]]'s Indoor [[60 metres]] title, and won his first of seven outdoor Scottish sprint titles.

Wells's big breakthrough came at the start of the 1978 season, when his times and victories began to improve, and he won the UK 100/[[200 metres|200]] Championships. British sprinters had made little impression on the international scene, and the sight of the [[Scot]] winning two [[gold medal]]s (200 m, [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 x 100 m]]), and a [[silver medal|silver]] (100 m) at the [[Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], [[Canada]], was a surprise for British athletics fans.

This success continued in 1979, when he won the European Cup 200 metres in [[Turin]], Italy, beating the new World record holder [[Pietro Mennea]] on his home ground; he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres.

At the start of the 1980 season, Wells won the AAA's 100 metres, then went to the [[Côte d'Azur]] to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Wells never used starting blocks, until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics. In Moscow, Wells qualified for the final, with a new British record 10.11 s, where he faced pre-race favourite [[Silvio Leonard]] of [[Cuba]]. By 60 metres the field were fading, and by 80 metres the race was between Leonard on the inside and Wells on the outside. Wells edged ahead, but Leonard drew even again. With seven metres to go Wells began an extreme lean which allowed his head and shoulder to cross the finish line 3 inches before Leonard's chest in a photo finish. Afterward both Wells and Leonard set a final time of 10.25 s, but Wells became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion at that time.<ref>http://www.sporting-heroes.net/athletics-heroes/displayhero.asp?HeroID=6921</ref>

The 200 m final was another close affair. Wells made up the stagger after only 50 metres. Coming out of the turn he had a two-metre lead over Leonard, with Quarrie and Mennea close behind. But Mennea shifted gears in the straight until he caught Wells with 10 metres to go. Wells attempted a final dip which had brought him victory in the 100, but he fell short, and Wells won the silver medal behind Pietro Mennea, who beat him by 0.02 s; again he set a British record of 20.21 s.

He went on to break a third British record, 38.62 s, with the sprint relay team that finished fourth in the final. Following the Moscow Olympics, there was a general feeling that Wells's gold medal had been devalued by the boycott of the games; however afterwards he beat all-comers after the games in Germany, which included the best American sprinters Mel Lattany, Stanley Floyd, Carl Lewis and Harvey Glance.
At the end of 1980, Wells was also awarded Scottish sports personality of the year.

In 1981, after a successful tour of Australia and New Zealand, Wells won the European Cup 100 metres, beating [[East Germany|East German]] [[Frank Emmelmann]]. Wells also finished 2nd in the 200.

He then demonstrated his calibre by finishing first in the "IAAF Golden sprints" in [[Berlin]]; which was the most prominent Sprint Meeting in the World that year. Although defeated by the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Hermann Panzo]] in the 100, Wells dominated the top four American sprinters Mel Lattany, Jeff Phillips, Stanley Floyd, Steve Williams as well as Canada's Ben Johnson  in the 100/200, 10.15/20.15 (200 wind assist) Wells winning the events in an aggregate 30.30.

To add to this, Wells won the 100 metres at the IAAF World cup in Rome, beating the American Champion and world's fastest 100m performer of the year which was 10.00 by [[Carl Lewis]]; Wells then finished 2nd in the world cup 200.

Afterwards, he beat the top Americans Mel Lattany and Stanley Floyd again, when he won a 200 in the [[Memorial Van Damme]] meeting in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].

In 1982, in [[Brisbane, Queensland]], [[Australia]], Wells won two more [[Commonwealth]] titles in the 100 m, a wind assisted 10.02. and then the 200 m, and a [[bronze medal]] in the relay. He shared the 200 m title with [[Mike McFarlane]] of England in a rare [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]].

In 1983, he won his 3rd European Cup title by winning the 200 metres, beating his old adversary Pietro Mennea in London, and again took 2nd in the 100.

He then went on and finished 4th in both the 100/200 sprint finals at the IAAF World Championships in [[Helsinki]].

He reached the 100 m semi-finals at the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]], and was a member of the relay team that finished 7th in the final.

Wells missed most of 1985 with injury. He was not selected for the [[1986 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh]] in 1986, as he had failed to compete at the Scottish trials. However, in a stunning comeback, he soundly beat both Johnson and Mahorn, the respective Commonwealth 100 m and 200 m champions, at [[Gateshead]]. Wells was consequently selected for [[Stuttgart]] in the European championships, coming fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m finals. To add to this, he also had a victory against [[Linford Christie]] at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] at the end of 1986. One of his last victories was winning the Inverness Highland Games 100/200 double in 1987.

Wells's later career was punctuated by injury, but by competing into his mid-30s he helped to set the trend for sprinters to have longer careers.

After retirement, he was a coach for the British [[bobsleigh]] team. His wife [[Margot Wells]] was also a Scottish 100/100 hurdles champion, and they are now based at [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] where she is a fitness consultant, and Allan is a systems engineer. Wells was also inducted alongside [[Eric Liddell]] and [[Wyndham Halswelle]] (two other former Scottish Athletic Olympic Champions) into the [[Scottish Sports Hall of Fame]]. Allan currently coaches the [[Bank of Scotland]] specialist sprint squad alongside another former Scottish sprinter, [[Ian Mackie]].
Wells's personal best for the 100 metres is 10.11, and for the 200 metres is 20.21, run at the [[Moscow 1980]] games, and both are still Scottish records.

==Trivia==

{{Trivia|date=August 2008}}
Wells featured in the video for [[Belle &amp; Sebastian]]'s song "I'm A Cuckoo".

In the mid-1980s, Allan was the first to be seen sporting cycling shorts, a precursor to the now omnipresent [[Lycra]] running shorts. The sight of these led to him being dubbed `Wilson of the Wizard` (an athletic comic book character from a bygone age).

Wells was also famous for his intense physical workouts, which included intense hill running, hops sprinting, [[circuit training]], and the use of a [[speedbag]].

Wells was the last white man to win an Olympic 100m final. Indeed 1980 was last time a white athlete made it to the men's 100m final.

In 1979 he ran a wind assisted 10.0 in the 100 metres in Grangemouth.

In 1980 he ran a wind assisted 9.2 in the 100 yards in Edinburgh.

In 1982 Wells also ran a wind assisted 19.8 in the 200 metres at a time trial for the commonwealth games in Meadowbank, Edinburgh.

Wells also recorded the fastest British 100/200 times from 1978,79,80,81,82, 1983,and 100m in 84.

<title>Allative case</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
'''Allative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''all'''}}; from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''allāt-'', ''afferre'' "to bring to") is a type of the [[locative case]]s used in several languages. The term '''allative''' is generally used for the [[lative case]] in the majority of languages which do not make finer distinctions.

==Finnish language==
In the [[Finnish language]], the allative is the fifth of the locative [[declension|cases]], with the basic meaning of "onto". Its ending is ''-lle'', for example ''pöytä'' (table) and ''pöydälle'' (onto the top of the table). In addition, it is the logical complement of the [[adessive case]] for referring to "being around the place". For example, ''koululle'' means "to the vicinity of the school". With time, the use is the same: ''ruokatunti'' (lunch break) and ''... lähti ruokatunnille'' ("... left to the lunch break"). Some actions require the case, e.g. ''kävely'' - ''mennä kävelylle'' "a walk - go for a walk".

The other locative cases in Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] are:
*[[Inessive case]] ("in")
*[[Elative case]] ("out of")
*[[Illative case]] ("into")
*[[Adessive case]] ("on")
*[[Ablative case]] ("from off of")

==Baltic languages==
In the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language]]s the allative had been used dialectally as an innovation since the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]], but it is almost out of use in modern times. Its ending in Lithuanian is ''-op'' which was shortened from ''-opi'', whereas its ending in Latvian is ''-up''. In the modern languages the remains of the allative can be found in certain fixed expressions that have become [[adverb]]s, such as '''Lit.''' ''išėjo Dievop'' ("gone to God", i.e. died), ''velniop!'' ("to hell!"), ''nuteisti myriop'' ("[[death sentence|sentence to death]]"), ''rudeniop'' ("towards autumn"), ''vakarop'' ("towards the evening") , '''Lat.''' ''mājup'' ("towards home"), ''kalnup'' ("uphill"), ''lejup'' ("downhill").

==Greek==
In [[Mycenaean Greek]], an [[enclitic]] ''-de'' ending is used to denote an allative.<ref>Ventris, Michael and John Chadwick. ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek''</ref> This ending survives into [[Ancient Greek]] in words such as {{Unicode|''Athē&#769;naze''}},<ref>{{LSJ|*)aqh{{=}}nai|Ἀθῆναι|ref}}</ref> from accusative {{Unicode|''Athē&#769;nās''}} + ''-de''.

==Accusative==
The [[Latin]] accusative of towns and small islands is used for motion towards,<ref>Allen and Greenough, sect. 427</ref> like the allative case.

The functionality of the library includes support for basic 2D graphics, image manipulation, text output, audio output, midi music, input and timers, as well as additional routines for fixed-point and floating-point [[matrix (math)|matrix]] arithmetic, unicode strings, file system access, file manipulation, data files, and (limited, software-only) 3D graphics.

As of version 4.0, programs that use the library work on [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[BeOS]], [[Mac OS X]], and various [[Unix-like|Unix-like systems]] with (or without) [[X Window System]], abstracting their [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) into one portable interface. There is also an independent port of Allegro on [[AmigaOS 4]].

The library is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and designed to be used with C or [[C++]]. It comes with extensive documentation and many examples.

==Addons==

The community of Allegro users have contributed several library extensions to handle things like scrolling tile maps and import and export of various file formats (e.g. [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]] images, [[MPEG]] video, [[Ogg]], [[MP3]], [[Impulse Tracker|IT]], [[S3M (file format)|S3M]], [[XM (mod format)|XM music]], [[TrueType|TTF]] [[typeface|fonts]], and more). There are also bindings for several programming languages available, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]] and others.

Allegro can be used in conjunction with [[OpenGL]] by using the library ''AllegroGL'' which extends Allegro's functionality into OpenGL and therefore the hardware.

==History==
Initially standing for "'''A'''tari '''L'''ow-'''Le'''vel '''G'''ame '''Ro'''utines",<ref>[http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/573313/574083#target Forum posting by Shawn Hargreaves]</ref> Allegro was originally created by [[Shawn Hargreaves]] for the [[Atari ST]] in the early 1990s. However, Shawn abandoned the Atari version as he realized the platform was dying, and reimplemented his work for the [[Borland]] C++ and [[DJGPP]] compilers in 1995. Support for Borland C++ was dropped in version 2.0, and DJGPP was the only supported compiler. As DJGPP was a [[DOS]] compiler, all games which used Allegro therefore used DOS. Around 1998, Allegro branched out into several versions. A port to [[Microsoft Windows]], WinAllegro, was created, and also during this time, a Unix port of Allegro, XwinAllegro, was created. These various ports were brought together during the Allegro 3.9 WIP versions, with Allegro 4.0 being the first stable version of Allegro to support multiple platforms. The current version of Allegro supports Unix ([[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Irix]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]), Windows ([[MSVC]], [[MinGW]], [[Cygwin]], [[Borland C++]]), [[Mac OS X]] and, up to the 4.2 version, [[BeOS]], [[QNX]], and DOS ([[DJGPP]], [[Watcom C Compiler|Watcom]]). An iPhone port is being developed too<ref>[https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.9/src/iphone/ the iPhone directory in the svn repository]</ref>. Shawn Hargreaves is no longer involved with Allegro.

For hardware accelerated 3D and 2D acceleration on Linux, Mac OS X and DOS, AllegroGL and OpenLayer are available. They are two add-on libraries that use [[OpenGL]] for accelerated graphics routines and use Allegro for all other gaming needs. Note that, combined with [[Glide API|Glide]] and [[Mesa 3D|MesaFX]] (using [[3dfx]] hardware), AllegroGL is one of the few available opensource solutions for hardware accelerated 3D under DOS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mesa 3-D graphics library|author=Daniel Borca <!-- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR -->|url=http://www.geocities.com/dborca/opengl/mesa.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmXKDZoH|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

** hardware scrolling and triple buffering (where available), mode-X split screen
** animation functions for FLI/FLC format<ref>[http://alleg.sourceforge.net/readme.html Allegro Introduction]</ref>

==Allegro 5==

Current development is focused on the Allegro 5 branch, with the current version 5.0.0 (RC4). Allegro 5 is a complete redesign of the API and much of the internal operation of the library. An effort was made to make the API more consistent, and multi-thread safe. By default, the library will now be hardware accelerated using OpenGL or DirectX rendering backends where appropriate. Many of the addons that existed as separate projects for Allegro 4 will be rewritten to interface more seamlessly with Allegro proper and will be bundled with the default installation.

==Allegro X3==

The unknown Allegro project called Allegro X3 which started in 2003 was to introduce two new platforms (Xbox, PS2)
unfortunately the project was abandoned because of insufficient funds and other unknown matters in development.

<title>Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps</title>
<text>[[File:Ostalpeneinteilung Vierteilung.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the classification of the Eastern Alps.<br/> Blue: Northern Limestone Alps, Yellow: Central Eastern Alps, Green: Southern Limestone Alps, Pink: Western Limestone Alps.]]

The '''Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps''' ({{lang-de|Alpenvereinseinteilung der Ostalpen}}) or '''AVE''' is a division of the Eastern Alps  into 75 mountain groups and is commonly used in [[mountaineering]]. There is a basic division into the ''[[Northern Limestone Alps]], [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Western Limestone Alps]],'' and ''[[Southern Limestone Alps]].'' These four main groups are further divided into 75 sub-groups.

== History ==
The Alpine Club's classification of the Eastern Alps was compiled by Franz Graßler in 1982 and published in 1984 in the Alpine Club yearbook, ''Berg '84''. It is based on the ''Moriggl Classification (ME)'' by [[Josef Moriggl]], the General Secretary of the [[German and Austrian Alpine Club]] (DuÖAV), which was first published in 1924 in the ''Ratgeber für Alpenwanderer'' ("Guide for Alpine Walkers", 2nd edition, 1928). This division of the Eastern Alps established for the German-speaking world (less Switzerland) was compiled by the [[German Alpine Club|German]], [[Austrian Alpine Club|Austrian]] and [[South Tyrol Alpine Club]]s. 

The classification is used ''inter alia'' for the basic numbering of [[Alpine Club maps]].

== Classification system ==
The Eastern Alps are divided into four areas: the Northern Limestone Alps, Central Eastern Alps, Southern Limestone Alps and Western Limestone Alps. The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each. The Southern Limestone Alps have 15 groups and there are six in the Western Limestone Alps.

The classification is based principally on [[orographic]] considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups. The Graßler amendments of 1984 address a number of geological problems and have dropped many of Morrigl's groups, making more precise sub-divisions for them in other areas. These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub-division letters. New areas were added to the Western Limestone Alps. This area is one not covered by the alpine clubs and is actually a continuation of the Southern and Central Alps.

Unlike the previous scheme, the [[Salzburg Slate Alps]] were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps because they are part of the [[greywacke zone]] that forms the [[bedrock]] of the Alps. The [[Ortler Alps]] and [[Sobretta Gavia Group]] were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps, geologically speaking, they are north of the [[Periadriatic Seam]] are counted as Austro-alpine.

== Geographical characteristics == 
The Eastern Alps extend across six countries: [[Germany]], [[Italy]] [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Slovenia]]. With 57 mountain groups, Austria has the largest share. It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten. There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia. Liechtenstein shares one group.

The only [[four-thousander]] and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the [[Piz Bernina]] at {{Höhe|4046}}. Thus the [[Bernina]] is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps. Next are the [[Ortler Alps]], whose highest peak, the [[Ortler]] ({{Höhe|3905}}), is the highest mountain in South Tyrol. The third highest range is the [[Glockner Group]] with the highest mountain in Austria: the [[Grossglockner]] ({{Höhe|3798}}). Another 22 groups reach a height of 3,000 metres. The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three-thousander is the [[Lech Valley Alps]], whose highest summit is the [[Parseierspitze]] ({{Höhe|3036}}). 39 groups are over 2000 metres high. Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres and only one does not reach that mark: the [[Vienna Woods]]. Its highest mountain, the [[Schöpfl]] is just  {{Höhe|893}} high.

<title>Alternating finite automaton</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
In [[automata theory]], an '''alternating finite automaton''' (AFA) is a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] whose transitions are divided into ''[[existential quantification|existential]]'' and ''[[universal quantification|universal]]'' transitions. For example, let ''A'' be an alternating [[automaton]].

* For an existential transition <math>(q, a, q_1 \vee q_2)</math>, ''A'' nondeterministically chooses to switch the state to either <math>q_1</math> or <math>q_2</math>, reading ''a''. Thus, behaving like a regular [[nondeterministic finite automaton]].
* For a universal transition <math>(q, a, q_1 \wedge q_2)</math>, ''A'' moves to <math>q_1</math> '''and''' <math>q_2</math>, reading ''a'', simulating the behavior of a parallel machine.

Note that due to the universal quantification a run is represented by a run ''tree''. ''A'' accepts a word ''w'', if there ''exists'' a run tree on ''w'' such that ''every'' path ends in an accepting state.

A basic theorem tells that any AFA is equivalent to an [[non-deterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) by performing a similar kind of powerset construction as it is used for the transformation of an NFA to a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA). This construction converts an AFA with ''k'' states to an NFA with up to <math>2^k</math> states.

An alternative model which is frequently used is the one where Boolean combinations are represented as ''clauses''. For instance, one could assume the combinations to be in [[Disjunctive normal form|Disjunctive Normal Form]] so that <math>\{\{q_1\},\{q_2,q_3\}\}</math> would represent <math>q_1 \vee (q_2 \wedge q_3)</math>. The state '''tt''' (''true'') is represented by <math>\{\{\}\}</math> in this case and '''ff''' (''false'') by <math>\varnothing</math>.
This clause representation is usually more efficient. 

==Formal Definition==
An alternating finite automaton (AFA) is a [[n-tuple|6-tuple]],
<math>(S(\exists), S(\forall), \Sigma, \delta, P_0, F)</math>, where

*<math>S(\exists)</math> is a finite set of existential states. Also commonly represented as <math>S(\vee)</math>.
*<math>S(\forall)</math> is a finite set of universal states. Also commonly represented as <math>S(\wedge)</math>.
*<math>\ \Sigma</math> is a finite set of input symbols.
*<math>\ \delta</math> is a set of transition [[function (mathematics)|functions]] to next state <math>(S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)) \times (\Sigma \cup \{ \varepsilon \} ) \to 2^{S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)}</math>.
*<math>\ P_0</math> is the initial (start) state, such that <math>P_0 \in S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)</math>.
*<math>\ F</math> is a set of accepting (final) states such that <math>F \subseteq S(\exists) \cup S(\forall)</math>.

<title>Alternative hypothesis</title>
<text>{{main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}
In [[statistical hypothesis testing]], 
the '''alternative hypothesis''' (or '''maintained hypothesis''' or '''research hypothesis''') and the [[null hypothesis]] are the two rival hypotheses which are compared by a [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis test]]. An example might be where water quality in a stream has been observed over many years and a test is made of the null hypothesis that there is no change in quality between the first and second halves of the data against the alternative hypothesis that the quality is poorer in the second half of the record.

The concept of an alternative hypothesis in testing was devised by [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]], and it is used in the [[Neyman–Pearson lemma]]. It forms a major component in modern [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. However it was not part of [[Ronald Fisher|Ronald Fisher's]] formulation of statistical hypothesis testing, and he violently opposed its use.<ref name="Cohen">[[Jacob Cohen (statistician)|Cohen, J.]] 1990. Things I have learned (so far). American Psychologist 45: 1304&amp;ndash;1312.</ref> In Fisher's approach to testing, the central idea is to assess whether the observed dataset could have resulted from chance if the null hypothesis were assumed to hold, notionally without preconceptions about what other model might hold. Modern statistical hypothesis testing accommodates this type of test since the alternative hypothesis can be just the negation of the null hypothesis.

<title>Alternative terms for free software</title>
<text>'''Alternative terms for free software''' have been a controversial issue among [[free software]] users from the late 1990s onwards.  Coined in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]], "free software" is used to describe [[software]] which can be used, modified, and redistributed with little or no restriction.  These freedoms are formally described in [[The Free Software Definition]], first published in February 1986.<ref name="bull6">{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt|title=GNU's Bulletin, Volume 1 Number 1, page 8}}</ref>

Alternatives for "free software" were sought for marketing purposes and because of a perceived "moralising and confrontational" attitude that had been associated with the term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/history|title=History of OSI|quote=conferees decided it was time to dump the moralizing and confrontational attitude that had been associated with "free software" in the past and sell the idea strictly on the same pragmatic, business-case grounds}}</ref> In addition, the "available at no cost" ambiguity of the word "free" was seen as discouraging business adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html|title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source"|quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.}}</ref>  In a 1998 strategy session in [[California]], "[[open source software]]" was selected by [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon "maddog" Hall|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Christine Peterson]], and [[Eric S. Raymond]].<ref>{{cite web

Those at the meeting described "open source" as a "replacement label" for free software <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html|title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source"|author=[[Eric Raymond]]|quote=we have a problem with the term "free software" ... we came up with a replacement label we all liked: "open source".
}}</ref> and [[Open Source Initiative]] was soon-after founded by Eric Raymond and [[Bruce Perens]] to promote the term as part of "a marketing program for free software".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060423094434/www.opensource.org/advocacy/faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Open Source Initiative|quote=How is "open source" related to "free software"?  The Open Source Initiative is a marketing program for free software.}}</ref>  Stallman and others object to the term "open source software" because it does not make people think of the freedoms that the software in question gives users.

Each of the terms "free software" and "open source software" has fans and critics. Partly because of the failure to adopt one specific term, other terms have been proposed.  These include "Software Libre" (or libre software), "FLOSS" (Free/Libre/Open Source Software), and "FOSS" (or F/OSS, [[Free and open source software|Free and Open Source Software]]). These terms share almost identical licence criteria and development practices.

== FOSS and F/OSS ==

{{Main|Free and open source software}}
The first known use of the phrase "free open source software" on [[Usenet]] was in a posting on 18 March 1998, just a month after the term "open source" itself was coined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/groups/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;num=10&amp;q=%22free+open+source+software%22&amp;safe=off&amp;qt_s=Search&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=1&amp;as_maxm=6&amp;as_maxy=1998
|title=Posting re "free open source software", 18 March 1998.}}</ref>
In February 2002, "F/OSS" appeared on a [[Usenet]] newsgroup dedicated to [[Amiga]] [[computer games]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.games/msg/4a192ea899e10c55
|title=using m$ products is supporting them :(}}</ref>  In early 2002, [[MITRE]] used the term "FOSS" in what would later be their 2003 report ''[[Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense]].''

== FLOSS ==

"FLOSS" was used in 2001 as a project acronym by [[Rishab Aiyer Ghosh]] as an acronym for ''free/libre/open source software''. Later that year, the [[European Commission]] (EC) used the phrase when they funded a study on the topic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flossproject.org/|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software: Survey and Study}}</ref>

Unlike "libre software", which aimed to solve the ambiguity problem, "FLOSS" aimed to avoid taking sides in the debate over whether it was better to say "free software" or to say "open source software".

Proponents of the term point out that parts of the FLOSS acronym can be translated into other languages, with for example the "F" representing ''free'' (English) or ''frei'' (German), and the "L" representing ''libre'' (Spanish or French), ''livre'' (Portuguese), or ''libero'' (Italian), and so on. However, this term is not often used in official, non-English, documents, since the words in these languages for "free as in freedom" do not have the ambiguity problem of English's "free".

By the end of 2004, the FLOSS acronym had been used in official English documents issued by South Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naci.org.za/floss/index.html|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software and Open Standards in South Africa: A Critical Issue for Addressing the Digital Divide|publisher=National Advisory Council on Innovation}}</ref> Spain,<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/1637/470|title=FLOSS deployment in Extremadura, Spain}}</ref> and Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/1727|title=Relatório da ONU aponta o Software Livre (FLOSS) como melhor}}</ref>

Richard Stallman endorses the term FLOSS to refer to "open source" and "free software" without necessarily choosing between the two camps, however, he asks people to consider supporting the "free software" camp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-interview-edinburgh.html|title=Interview with Richard Stallman, Edinburgh, 2004
|publisher=Free Software Foundation}}</ref> Stallman has suggested that the term "unfettered software" would be an appropriate, non-ambiguous replacement, but that he would not push for it because there was too much momentum and too much effort behind the term "free software".

== Software Libre==

"Software Libre" was first used publicly in 2000, by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eu.conecta.it/|title=European Working Group on Software Libre}}</ref>  The word "libre", borrowed from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] languages, means having liberty.  This avoids the freedom/cost ambiguity of the [[English language|English]] word "free".

==Non-English terms in anglophone regions==

The [[free software community]] in [[India]] sometimes uses the term "[[wikt:Swatantra|Swatantra]] software" since the term "Swatantra" means free in [[Sanskrit]], which is the ancestor of all [[Indo-European Languages]] of India, including [[Hindi]], despite [[English language|English]] being the [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.fsf.org.in/
|title=FSF-India's homepage
|quote=Think of it as swatantra software
}}</ref>

In [[The Philippines]], "malayang software" is sometimes used.  The word "libre" exists in the [[Filipino language]], and it came from the Spanish language, but has acquired the same cost/freedom ambiguity of the English word "free".<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://archives.free.net.ph/message/20020628.083546.ed5f57f6.en.html
|title=Re: Free Software, some thoughts
|quote=My suspicion is that if RMS were Filipino, he would have used Malayang Software to avoid the confusion regarding economics v. liberty.
}}</ref>

==Ownership and attachments==

None of these terms, or the term "free software" itself, have been trademarked. [[Bruce Perens]] of OSI attempted to register "open source" as a [[service mark]] for OSI in the [[United States of America]], but that attempt failed to meet the relevant [[trademark]] standards of specificity. OSI claims a trademark on "OSI Certified", and applied for trademark registration, but did not complete the paperwork.  The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] labels it as "abandoned".<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/
|title=Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)
|quote=(Direct link not possible, site search required) Word Mark: OSI CERTIFIED ... Goods and Services: (ABANDONED) IC A . US A . G &amp; S: software licensed under open source licenses. ... Serial Number: 76020694 ... Owner: (APPLICANT) Open Source Initiative ... Live/Dead Indicator: DEAD
}}</ref>

While the term "free software" is associated with FSF's definition, and the term "open source software" is associated with OSI's definition, the other terms have not been claimed by any group in particular.  FSF's and OSI's definitions are worded quite differently but the set of software that they cover is almost identical.<ref>{{cite web
|title=Why “Open Source” misses the point of Free Software
|author=FSF
|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
|quote=Nearly all open source software is free software; the two terms describe almost the same category of software.

|url=http://perens.com/works/speeches/InnovationGoesPublic/Speech/1.html
|title=Innovation Goes Public
|quote=(javascript slide #3)When I say "Open Source", I mean the same thing as Free Software.
}}</ref>

All of the terms are used interchangeably, the choice of which to use is mostly political (wanting to support a certain group) or practical (thinking that one term is the clearest).

==Licenses==
The choice of term has little or no impact on which licences are valid.  The vast majority of software referred to by these terms is distributed under a small set of licences, all of which are unambiguously accepted by the various de facto and de jure guardians of each of these terms.  50-70% of this software is under the [[GNU General Public License]], and most of the rest is distributed under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], the [[BSD licenses]], the [[Mozilla Public License]], the [[MIT License]], and the [[Apache License]], each with a share of between 2% and 10%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html|title=Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else.}}</ref>

The [[Free Software Foundation]] and the [[Open Source Initiative]] each publish lists of licenses that they accept as complying with their definitions of free software and open source software respectively.

*[[List of FSF approved software licenses]]
*[[List of OSI approved software licenses]]

Apart from these two organisations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licences comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].  Debian does not publish a list of "approved" licences, but its judgments can be tracked by checking what licences are used by software they have allowed into their distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/|title=License information|publisher=Debian}}</ref>  In addition, the [[Fedora Project]] does provide a list of approved licenses (for Fedora) based on approval of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and consultation with Red Hat Legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/|title=Licensing|publisher=Fedora}}</ref>

There is also a class of software that is covered by the names discussed in this article, but which doesn't have a licence: software for which the source code is in the [[public domain]].  The use of such source code, and therefore the executable version, is not restricted by copyright and therefore does not need a [[free software licence]] to make it free software.

<title>Altix</title>
<text>'''Altix''' is a line of [[Server (computing)|servers]] and [[supercomputer]]s produced by [[Silicon Graphics]](International),  based on [[Intel]] [[central processing unit|processors]]. It succeeded the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]/[[IRIX]]-based [[SGI Origin 3000|Origin 3000]] servers.

The line was first announced<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/77311/SGI_releases_Linux_supercomputer_with_Itanium_processor?taxonomyId=122]</ref> on January 7, 2003, with the '''Altix 3000''' series, based on [[Intel]] [[Itanium 2]] processors and SGI's [[NUMAlink]] processor interconnect.  At product introduction, the system supported up to 64 processors running Linux as a [[single system image]] and shipped with a Linux distribution called SGI Advanced Linux Environment, which was compatible with Red Hat Advanced Server.  By August 2003, many SGI Altix customers<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/SGI-aims-high-with-Altix-machine/2100-1001_3-5094162.html ]</ref> were running Linux on 128p and even 256p SGI Altix systems, but SGI officially announced 256-processor support<ref>[http://www.linuxtoday.com/high_performance/2004031001626NWHESV]</ref> within a single system image of Linux on March 10, 2004 using an 2.4-based kernel.  The SGI Advanced Linux Environment was eventually dropped after support using a standard, unmodified [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] (SLES) distribution for SGI Altix was provided with SLES 8<ref name="developer.novell.com">[http://developer.novell.com/yes/77348.htm]</ref> and SLES 9<ref name="developer.novell.com"/>.  Later, SGI Altix  512-processor systems were officially supported<ref>[http://developer.novell.com/yes/80546.htm]</ref> using unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 9 SP1.  Besides full support of SGI Altix on [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]], a standard and unmodified [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was also fully supported starting with SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 with  RHEL 4<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=147520]</ref> and  RHEL 5<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=235908]</ref> with system processor limits defined by Red Hat for those releases.  

On 14 November 2005, SGI introduced the '''Altix 4000''' series based on the Itanium 2.<ref>[[Silicon Graphics|Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] (14 November 2005). ''SGI Launches New Flagship Altix 4000 Platform''. ([[Press release]]).</ref> The Altix 3000 and 4000 are [[distributed shared memory]] [[Multiprocessing|multiprocessor]]s.  SGI later officially supported 1024-processors systems on an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of  SLES 10<ref>[http://developer.novell.com/yes/84529.htm]</ref> in July 2006.  SGI Altix 4700 was also officially supported by Red Hat with  RHEL 4<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=195732]</ref> and  RHEL 5<ref>[http://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=230481]</ref>&amp;mdash;maximum processor limits were as defined by Red Hat for its RHEL releases.

The Altix brand has been also used for a variety of systems based on [[multi-core]] Intel [[Xeon]] processors. These includes the '''Altix XE''' [[rackmount]] servers, '''Altix ICE''' [[blade server]]s and '''Altix UV''' supercomputers.

[[NASA]]'s [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]] [[supercomputer]], installed in 2004, is a 10,240-microprocessor cluster of twenty Altix 3000 systems, each with 512 microprocessors, interconnected with [[InfiniBand]].

== Altix 3000 ==

The Altix 3000 was the first generation of Altix systems. It was succeeded by the Altix 4000 in 2004, and the last model was discontinued on 31 December 2006.

=== Altix 330 ===

The '''Altix 330''' is an entry-level server. Unlike the high-end models, the Altix 330 is not "brick" based, but is instead based on 1U-high compute modules mounted in a rack and connected with [[NUMAlink]]. A single system may contain 1 to 16 Itanium 2 processors and 2 to 128 GB of memory.

=== Altix 350 ===

The '''Altix 350''' is a mid-range model which supports up to 32 Itanium 2 processors.

=== Altix 1330 ===

The '''Altix 1330''' is a [[cluster (computing)|cluster]] of Altix 330 systems. The systems are networked with [[gigabit Ethernet]] or 4X [[Infiniband]].

=== Altix 1350 ===

The '''Altix 1350''' is a cluster of Altix 350 systems.

=== Altix 3300 ===

The '''Altix 3300''' is a mid-range model supporting 4 to 12 processors and 2 to 48 GB of memory. It is packaged in a short (17U) rack.

=== Altix 3700 ===

The '''Altix 3700''' is a high-end model supporting 16 to 512 processors and 8 GB to 2 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (39U) rack(s). A variant of the Altix 3000 with graphics capability is known as the [[SGI Prism|Prism]].

It is based on the third generation NUMAflex [[distributed shared memory]] architecture and it uses the [[NUMAlink#NUMAlink 4|NUMAlink 4]] interconnection fabric. The Altix 3000 supports a single system image of 64 processors. If there are more than 64 processors in a system, then the system must be partitioned.

The basic building block is the C-brick. Each C-brick contains two nodes. A C-brick is a 4U high rackmount unit. Each node contains two [[Intel]] [[Itanium|Itanium 2]] processors which connects to the Super-Bedrock [[Application specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] through a single [[front side bus]]. The Super-Bedrock ASIC is a [[crossbar]] for the processors, the local RAM, the network interface and the I/O interface. The two Super-Bedrock ASICs in each brick are connected internally by a single 6.4 GB/s NUMAlink 4 channel. A processor node also contains 16 [[DIMM]] slots that accept standard [[DDR1]] DIMMs with capacities of 4 to 16 GB.

=== Altix 3700 Bx2 ===

The '''Altix 3700 Bx2''' is a high-end model supporting 16 to 2,048 Itanium 2 processors and 12 GB to 24 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (40U) rack(s).

== Altix 4000 ==

The '''Altix 4000''' is Silicon Graphics' current Itanium-based product line. It is composed of two models, the '''Altix 450''', a mid-range server, and the '''Altix 4700''', a high-end server.

An Altix 4700 system can contain up to 2048 dual-core Itanium 2 and Itanium ("Montvale" revision) microprocessor sockets, which are connected by the [[NUMAlink|NUMAlink 4]] interconnect in a [[fat tree]] network topology.<ref>[http://www.sgi.com/products/servers/altix/4000/configs.html SGI Altix 4700: Configurations]</ref> The microprocessors are accompanied by up to 128 TB of memory (192TB with single microprocessor socket blades and 16GB DIMMs).

These systems are based on nodes contained within a [[Blade (computing)|blade]] that plugs into an enclosure, the individual rack unit (IRU). The IRU is a 10U enclosure that contains the necessary components to support the blades such as the power supplies, two router boards (one for every five blades) and a L1 controller. Each IRU can support ten single-wide blades or two double-wide blades and eight single-width blades. The IRUs are mounted in 42U-high rack, and each rack supports up to four IRUs.

There are two types of node, processor and memory, which are contained within a blade. Compute blades contain a processor node and consist of two PAC611 sockets for Itanium 2 and Itanium microprocessors, a Super-Hub (SHub) [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) ([[chipset]]) and eight [[dual in-line memory module]] (DIMM) slots for memory. The number of microprocessor sockets in a compute blade is one or two. One-processor socket configurations provide more bandwidth as only one microprocessor socket is using the front side bus and local memory. Two-processor socket configurations do not support hyperthreading. Memory blades are used to expand the amount of memory without increasing the number of processors. They contain a SHub ASIC and 12 DIMM slots. Both compute and memory blades support 1, 2 4, 8, and 16 GB DIMMs.  SGI support does not currently support any installations with 16GB DIMMs.

Multiple servers in configurations described above can be combined on the same Numalink fabric up to the theoretical maximum of 8,192 nodes (16,384 OS cpus).

== Altix XE ==

The '''Altix XE''' servers are based on Intel [[Xeon]] [[x86-64]]-architecture processors. Models include the:

* '''Altix XE210''' server supported up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, 1 x PCIe x8 (low profile) and 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height) PCI slots, and Three SATA/SAS drive bays.

== Altix ICE ==

The '''Altix ICE''' blade platform is an Intel Xeon-based system featuring diskless compute blades and a Hierarchical Management Framework (HMF) for scalability, performance, and resiliency.  While the earlier Itanium-based Altix systems ran a [[single-system image]] (SSI) [[Linux kernel]] on 1024 processors or more using a standard [[SuSE Linux Enterprise Server]] (SLES) distribution, the Altix ICE's clustering capabilities uses standard SLES or [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] distributions and scales to over 51,200 cores on [[NASA]]'s [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades]] [[supercomputer]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The '''Altix ICE 8200LX''' blade enclosure featured two 4x DDR IB switch blade and one high performing plane, while the '''Altix ICE 8200EX''' featured four 4x DDR IB switch blades, and two high performing planes.  Both configurations supported either [[hypercube]] or [[fat tree]] topology, and 16 compute blades within an IRU.

The IP-83 and IP-85 compute blades supported Intel Xeon 5200 or 5400 Series processors, and the IP-95 compute blade supported Intel Xeon 5500 Series processors.

{{As of|2010|11|alt=As of fall 2010}}, the current product is the ICE 8400, based on either Intel Xeon 5500 or 5600 processors or the AMD Opteron 6100 series processors.

==Altix UV==
The Altix UV supercomputer architecture was announced in November 2009. Codenamed ''Ultraviolet'' during development, the Altix UV combines a development of the NUMAlink interconnect used in the Altix 4000 (NUMAlink 5) with quad-, six- or eight-core "[[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem-EX]]" Intel Xeon 7500 processors. Altix UV systems run either SuSE Linux Enterprise Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and scale from 32 to 2,048 cores with support for up to 16 Terabytes (TB) of shared memory in a single system image.<ref name="altix-uv-pr">{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2009/november/altix_uv.html|title=SGI Unveils Altix UV, the World's Fastest Supercomputer|date=2009-11-16|work=www.sgi.com|publisher=[[Silicon Graphics International]]|accessdate=2009-11-18}}</ref>

<title>AmBX</title>
<text>[[AmBX]] (officially stylized amBX) is an internationally [[patented]] technology (originally developed by a [[Philips]] research project which also produced their [[Ambilight]] technology) for controlling  incandescant and white/coloured [[LED]] lighting and other enabled devices. This allows lighting designers, end users and content providers (of videogames, films, music, programs and websites) to create and enjoy immersive experiences by the triggering of specially developed [[AmBX]] enabled devices.

The [[AmBX]] technology is now owned by a british company based in Redhill, [[amBX UK LTD]].

[[AmBX]] enabled devices deliver many effects; lighting, airflow, rumble and others. [[AmBX]] is a controlling technology that enables devices (via generic input, scripted scenes or embeded code) to synchronise with any game, sound and video content in real time. As well as LED lights, rumble kit and fans, other types of devices which have been prototyped include heat and water atomisers. The  events triggering effects can be layered and a 'rest' effect can also be generated when content is inactive.

The technology  works seamlessly with all legacy source content (incuding video and PC games). Content that has specially scripted [[AmBX]] code embeded can trigger a reaction to on screen video and audio output with any immersive/ambient device effects the designers require. 

[[AmBX]] has a proprietary professional hardware product (amBIENT XC) but allows other hardware manufacturers with a [[licensing agreement]] to create [[AmBX]] enabled hardware capable of delivering the [[AmBX]] experience.

[[AmBX]] technology (via the amBIENT XC) also  'talks' to lighting industry standard control interfaces and light sources via the [[DMX512]] control language.

[[AmBX]] technology is available for the home user, PCs and professional and commercial lighting (stage, shops, bars, restaurants, clubs, AV installations and offices). Game consoles, mobile phone apps, film and other entertainment media are also expected to follow.<ref>http://www.ambx.com/wiki/Main_Page</ref>

== How it works ==
'''Technology'''

[[AmBX]] code acts as a conversion middleware (sitting between source and output device) that takes generic or specificaly scripted (via [[AmBX]] SDK) input signals from video, audio, PC or media content, then outputs it to suitable harware such as LED lights, rumble boxes or similar devices via cable or wirless, subject to hardware.

'''Embedded code'''

For the full experience and to trigger specific events/effects, developers embed code (via free SDK dowload) into their applications to tell the devices what to do. Current developers and publishers using [[AmBX]] include [[Ubisoft]], [[THQ]], [[Codemasters]], [[Gamecock]], [[Gearbox Software]], [[Introversion Software]]<ref>http://www.gamezone.com/news/item/introversion_announces_ambx_version_of_defcon/</ref> and [[Spark Unlimited|Spark]]. [[AmBX]] licenses the technology to content providers for free. [[AmBX]] technology works with generic content of any age.

The latest [[AmBX]]-enabled games include ''[[Far Cry 2]]'', ''[[Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X.]]'', ''[[Multiwinia]]'', ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising]]'', and ''[[Legendary (video game)|Legendary]]''.

'''Legacy and non-enabled games'''

The [[AmBX]] FXGen is a piece of software that forms part of the standard software install that analyses on-screen events and triggers the AmBX peripherals to generate effects. For games [[AmBX]] isn't embedded in, such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Crysis]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', the AmBX software team provide constant updates (currently FOC), allowing  these games to work in a hybrid fashion, creating effects that sit somewhere between generic and fully [[AmBX]] scripted ones, meaning there is a large amount of [[AmBX]] enhanced gameplay available (including popular online games).

'''Films and Music'''

When using the current Philips AmBX enabled PC Gaming peripherals (or Mad Catz gaming lights) to watch films and music [[AmBX]] generates immersive lighting effects when viewing popular media players. These include [[iTunes]], [[Quick Time]], [[VLC media player]], [[Media Player Classic]], and [[Winamp]]. Different presets are available: Moderate, Colour, Relaxed and Dynamic.

'''PC usage'''

In October 2008 [[AmBX UK LTD]] announced a new application called [[AmBX]] Creator which for the first time allows [[AmBX]] users to create their own effects and tag them to events on the PC e.g. multicoloured light shows when you get emails.<ref>http://www.ambx.com/site/consumer/games/applications/creator</ref>

'''Research and Development'''

[[AmBX]] is being trialled and developed for a variety of diverse applications including wireless alerts for the hard of hearing, possible treatments for seasonally affected depression, jet lag and other media, educational and healthcare applications.

Currently the amBIENT XC controls a single DMX universe, recent trialls (2011 and ongoing) have increased this to three, with further improvements likely. In the medium term the technology could output (reflect/mimic) video in enhanced definition.

==Equipment and product==


[[AmBX]] technology is now available for the professional and the consumer markets in three formats, PC peripherals, discontinued [[Philips]] Kits and [[Mad Catz]] Cyborg PC Gaming Lights (January 2011 launch at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]), [[AmBX]] amBIENT XC professional controller box and as a freely downloadable SDK from the [[AmBX]] website.

'''Professional'''

amBIENT XC is [[AmBX]]'s professional lighting control unit (from 2010) that is used for architectural, stage, commercial and events applications and also for high end AV installations.

'''Consumer'''

[[Mad Catz]] have incorporated the technology into their latest pro gaming Cyborg brand via [[AmBX]] enabled PC gaming lights (available 2011) and an [[AmBX]] enabled gaming PC keyboard (available 2011).

[[AmBX]] technology allows multiple hardware installations, i.e. more than one set of lights, the software automatically knows its hardware extensions and controls accordingly, more light sets, more/better immersive effects.


'''Legacy'''

[[Philips]] produced the first commercially available [[AmBX]] enabled consumer equipment in 2007. Available in basic or advanced forms which included [[LED]] and speaker units, LED wall washers and fan and rumble devices.

The table shows the configuration of the original (discontinued, but still available) Philips gaming kits (large installed user base). These kits come with speakers integrated into each satellite light.

Although each [[wallwasher]] (rear lights) supports a maximum of two satellite lights, two fans, and one rumble pad, several kits may be used on a single PC to create a larger setup. Wallwashers may be used independently of all other devices, but are required for all AmBX applications via [[Philips]] kits.

[[Image:Amar Gupta Picture.png|thumb|right|A 2007 photo of Dr. Amar Gupta]]
'''Amar Gupta''' is an [[Financial endowment|endowed professor]] of entrepreneurship, management and organizations, computer science, and Latin American studies at the University of Arizona.

==Background==
'''Amar Gupta''' (born 1953) was born in [[Nadiad]], [[India]]. Gupta was admitted to the prestigious [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], [[Kanpur]] to study [[electrical engineering]], graduating in 1974. Gupta started his career working making 8 dollars a week working for IBM, and then served in various technical advisory roles for the Government of [[India]].He received the Rotary Fellowship for International Understanding. This allowed Gupta to pursuit his graduate studies with the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. This was the start of a 25 year relationship (1979–2004), where he was first person to have attained the rank of Senior Research Scientist at MIT Sloan. In this position, he launched the United States’ first course on international outsourcing <ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/11/news/companies/mit_outsourcing/index.htm "New MBA course: Outsourcing "], http://money.cnn.com/ article cites course ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref>
with the help of Professor [[Lester Thurow]], eminent economist and former Dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management. Gupta has provided his expertise to several [[UN]] organizations including [[WHO]], [[UNDP]], and [[UNIDO]] for various works in [[Latin America]] and the [[World Bank]] as an advisor on a Distance education endeavor in [[Mozambique]].  Amar Gupta's current appointment is at the [[Eller College of Management]] at the [[University of Arizona]] as the Professor of [[Entrepreneurship]] and MIS; and Senior Director for Research and Business Development. Amar Gupta has developed patented technology and has made innovations in several areas including databases, imaging, healthcare, education, and outsourcing.

==Contributions and Innovations==
Amar Gupta has contributed to the following areas through mentoring of students, personal research, scientific discoveries resulting in patents<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F5633954 "United States Patent"],''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref>
, and contributing ideas that have influenced research in these disciplines.

===Imaging===
Gupta served as chief scientist and vice president for the development of [[VCN ExecuVision]], the first presentation graphics program. This program changed the manner that presentations were given, first in the academic community before making its way to the business community. The company, Visual Communications Network also pioneered the development of [[clip art]] for the IBM personal computer.

At [[MIT]], Gupta led a team of researchers to develop technology to automatically read handwritten information on checks and proposed a nationwide check clearance system, allowing the electronic clearance of printed, typed, and handwritten checks.<ref>[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/2002-gupta.php "Gupta eyes paperless check clearance "], [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT Sloan]] Newsroom ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> This innovation is manifested in the [[Check 21]] in the U.S. and in similar approaches in Singapore, and Brazil. Gupta and his colleagues also developed the first microcomputer-based image database management system.

===Education===
Amar Gupta, created the first course on outsourcing of professional services, with [[Lester Thurow]], and taught it at [[MIT]] in 2004.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/outsourcing/ "Course description"], [[MIT]] ''URL retrieved on March 6, 2007.''</ref> The aim of the course neither to praise the benefits nor discuss the horror stories of outsourcing. The course discussed both the reasons outsourcing in more common in the business place and bring in CEO’s and economic leaders to discuss their experiences with this movement<ref>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/475952.cms "India the big topic in B-schools abroad"], [[The Economic Times]] ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> This pioneer course has been replicated at several other leading universities in the U.S. and abroad. 

Gupta launched the first academic program that leads to two graduate degrees and a certificate in entrepreneurship.  This involves a management degree from the [[University of Arizona]]’s [[Eller College of Management]], and a second graduate degree in optics science, engineering, agriculture, or medicine.

===Outsourcing===
The concept of the [24-Hour Knowledge Factory] was developed by Amar Gupta. This concept allows for multiple professionals in different geographical locations to work together to perform a single task or project. Research is being conducted to utilize this model in a variety of industries. In 2007, Gupta was awarded an IBM faculty award for this vision. 

In early 1980, Amar Gupta proposed to Citibank to do software development work in India. This idea turned into Citibank overseas Software Limited, the pioneer example of a large multinational bank doing such work in India.

<title>American Computer Science League</title>
<text>'''ACSL''' , or the '''American Computer Science League''', is an international [[computer science]] competition among more than 200 [[school]]s. Each round consists of two parts: a written section and a programming section.  Written topics tested include "what does this program do?", [[digital electronics]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[computer numbering formats|computer numbering systems]], [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s, [[data structures]] (primarily dealing with [[binary search tree]]s, [[stack (data structure)|stacks]], and [[Queue (data structure)|queues]]), [[Lisp programming language|lisp programming]], [[regular expressions]] and [[Finite state machine|Finite State Automata]], bit string flicking, [[graph theory]], [[assembly language|assembly programming]] and [[prefix notation|prefix]]/[[postfix notation|postfix]]/[[infix notation|infix]] notation.

==Divisions==
There are four divisions in ACSL: Classroom, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior.  Junior is recommended for middle school students (no students above the ninth grade may compete in it).  Intermediate and Senior divisions are for secondary school students, Intermediate being easier and Senior being more difficult.  At the "All-Star" (final) competition, the Junior teams consist of 5 members each while the Senior and Intermediate teams can consist of 3 or 5 members.  Each team competes against other same-sized teams in its division.

==Preliminary Competition==
The preliminary competition, in which individual students compete to get their school team qualified for the All-Star competition, consists of four rounds.  These rounds consist of a programming and a written part.  In the programming part, students have 72 hours to complete a program in any [[computer language]] to perform a given task.  In the written part, students have a total of 30 minutes to answer 5 questions based on given topics.  Students then receive a score of up to 10 points (5 for written and 5 for programming).  For the Classroom division, students receive 45 minutes to solve 10 written problems.

==All-Star Competition==
The All-Star Competition is held at a different location every year.  Teams are given 3 hours to earn up to 60 (40 for Junior Division) points by successfully completing various programs.  Individuals are then given 1 hour (45 minutes for Junior Division) to take a 12 (8 for Junior Division) question multiple choice test based on the subjects of the written questions in the preliminary rounds.  The scores of the programming and the team's individual scores are added together to determine the winners.  Prizes are given to teams with the highest scores and individuals based on their performance on the multiple choice test.

<title>American National Corpus</title>
<text>The '''American National Corpus''' (ANC) is a  [[text corpus]] of [[American English]] currently containing 22 million words written and spoken data produced since 1990. The ANC includes a range of genres comparable to the [[British National Corpus]] and is annotated for [[Lexical category|part of speech]] and [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]], [[shallow parsing|shallow parse]], and [[Named entity|named entities]].

The full 22 million word ANC is available from the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. A 15 million word subset of the corpus, called the '''Open American National Corpus''' (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website].

The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of [[ISO/TC 37]] SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool, the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including the XML format conformant to the [[XCES|XML Corpus Encoding Standard (XCES)]] (usable with the [[British National Corpus]]'s XAIRA search engine), a [[UIMA]]-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software.

The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different [[Lexical category|part of speech]] annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), [[shallow parsing|shallow parse annotations]], and  annotations for several types of [[Named entity|named entities]]. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on-line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full-text linguistic annotation.

ANC annotations are automatically-produced and unvalidated. A '''Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus''' (MASC) will be released in Fall 2009,{{Update after|2010|11|25}} which includes validated annotations for the above-mentioned phenomena as well as [[Treebank|Penn Treebank]] syntactic annotation, [[WordNet]] sense annotation, and [[FrameNet]] semantic frame annotations.

In Fall, 2009, the OANC Ngram Search Engine will become available on the [http://www.anc.org/ ANC Website], which will provide intra- and inter-sentential pattern-based searches. In early 2010, the OANC will be expanded to include an additional 20-30 million words of written and spoken data.{{Update after|2010|11|25}}

:''In this article, inhabitants of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] that supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as "Americans," with occasional references to "[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]", "Whigs," "Rebels" or "Revolutionaries". Colonists who supported the British in opposing the Revolution are usually referred to as "[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]" or "Tories". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as "America".''

<!--Actual article beginning-->
[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. The tallest of the five is laying a document on a table.|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the [[Committee of Five|five-man committee]] in charge of drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]
The '''American Revolution''' was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] in [[North America]] joined together to break free from the [[British Empire]], combining to become the [[United States|United States of America]]. They first rejected the authority of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a [[Provincial Congress]], or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual self-governing [[State (polity)|states]]. The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule. Through representatives sent in 1775 to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the new states joined together at first to defend their respective [[self-governance]] and manage the armed conflict against the British known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83, also ''American War of Independence''). Ultimately, the states collectively determined that the British monarchy, by acts of [[tyrant|tyranny]], could no longer [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimately]] claim their [[allegiance]]. They then severed ties with the British Empire in July 1776, when the Congress issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], rejecting the monarchy on behalf of the new [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] nation. The war ended with effective American victory in October 1781, followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United States with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.

The American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in early American society and government, collectively referred to as the ''[[American Enlightenment]]''. Americans rejected the [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]] common in [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Europe at the time, championing instead the development of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] understanding of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government [[Consent of the governed|responsible to the will of the people]]. However, sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of [[democracy]] desirable in the new government, with a number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] fearing [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].

Many fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, which replaced the relatively weaker first attempt at a national government adopted in 1781, the ''[[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]]''. In contrast to the loose [[confederation]], the Constitution established a strong [[Federation|federated]] government. The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1791), comprising the first 10 constitutional amendments, quickly followed. It guaranteed many "[[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]" that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a strong national government with relatively broad [[Liberty|personal liberties]]. The American shift to liberal republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States.<ref name="Wood, 1992">Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)</ref><ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70</ref>

==Origins==
[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.jpg|thumb|alt=Before the revolution: the thirteen colonies are in pink|Before the Revolution: The [[Thirteen Colonies]] are in pink]]
The American Revolution was predicated by a number of ideas and events that, combined, led to a political and social separation of colonial possessions from the home nation and a coalescing of those former individual colonies into an independent nation.

===Summary===
The American revolutionary era began in 1763, after a series of victories by British forces at the conclusion of the [[French and Indian War]] ended the French military threat to British North American colonies. Adopting the policy that the colonies should pay an increased proportion of the costs associated with keeping them in the Empire, Britain imposed a [[Stamp Act 1765|series of direct taxes]] followed by [[Intolerable Acts|other laws]] intended to demonstrate British authority, all of which proved extremely unpopular in America. Because [[No taxation without representation|the colonies lacked elected representation]] in the governing British Parliament, [[Sons of Liberty|many colonists]] considered the laws to be illegitimate and a violation of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]]. In 1772, groups of colonists began to create ''[[Committee of correspondence|Committees of Correspondence]]'', which would lead to their own Provincial Congresses in most of the colonies. In the course of two years, the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents rejected the Parliament and effectively replaced the British ruling apparatus in the former colonies, culminating in 1774 with the coordinating [[First Continental Congress]].<ref>Brinkley, ''The Sparck of Rebellion'' (2010)</ref> In response to protests in [[Boston]] over Parliament's attempts to assert authority, the British sent combat troops, [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]] local governments, and imposed direct rule by Royal officials. Consequently, the Colonies mobilized their [[Militia (United States)|militias]], and fighting broke out in 1775. First ostensibly loyal to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], the repeated [[Olive Branch Petition|pleas]] by the First Continental Congress for royal intervention on their behalf with Parliament resulted in the [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaration by the King]] that the states were "in rebellion", and the members of Congress were [[Treason|traitors]]. In 1776, representatives from each of the original thirteen states voted unanimously in the Second Continental Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence, which now rejected the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]] in addition to its Parliament. The Declaration established the United States, which was originally governed as a loose confederation through a [[representative democracy]] selected by state legislatures (see ''[[Second Continental Congress]]'' and ''[[Congress of the Confederation]]'').

====Ideology behind the Revolution====

The ideological movement known as the American Enlightenment was a critical precursor to the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism, democracy, republicanism, and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. Collectively, the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.

[[John Locke]]'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty greatly influenced the political thinking behind the revolution. John Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government]], published in 1689, influenced the thinking of later philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), as reflected in Rousseau's 1762 treatise entitled ''[[The Social Contract|Du contrat social]]''. The theory of the "[[social contract]]" influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to overthrow their leaders]], should those leaders betray the historic [[rights of Englishmen]].<ref>Wraight, ''Rousseau's The Social Contract'' (2008)</ref><ref name="Toth1989">Charles W. Toth, ''Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite: The American Revolution and the European Response.'' (1989) p. 26.</ref><ref name="Cohen2008">page 101, Philosophical Tales, by Martin Cohen, (Blackwell 2008)</ref> In terms of writing state and national constitutions, the Americans used [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]'s analysis of the "balanced" British Constitution.

A motivating force behind the revolution was the American embrace of a political ideology called "republicanism", which was dominant in the colonies by 1775. The republicanism was inspired by the "[[Whig (British political party)|country party]]" in Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that [[political corruption|corruption]] was a terrible reality in Britain.<ref>name= Weintraub2005>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) chapter 1</ref> Americans feared the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights, energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed.<ref>Bailyn, '' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 125-37</ref> The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in [[London]] but at home as well. The colonists associated it with luxury and, especially, inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.<ref>Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 35, 174-5</ref>

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]],<ref>Shalhope, ''Toward a Republican Synthesis'' (1972) pp.49-80</ref> which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen and countrywomen. John Adams, writing to [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1776, agreed with some [[Classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Roman thinkers in that "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics." He continued: <blockquote>
"There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures, Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society."<ref name="Rahe1994">Adams quoted in Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution. Volume: 2'' (1994) P. 23.</ref>
</blockquote> For women, "[[republican motherhood]]" became the ideal, exemplified by [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation.

Thomas Paine's best-seller pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence, by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.<ref>Ferguson, ''The Commonalities of Common Sense'' (2000) pp. 465–504</ref>

[[Dissenter|Dissenting]] (i.e. Protestant, non-[[Church of England]]) churches of the day were the "school of democracy”<ref name="Bonomi">Bonomi, p. 186, Chapter 7 “Religion and the American Revolution</ref> President [[John Witherspoon]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Hebrew Bible. Throughout the colonies dissenting Protestant congregations ([[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Baptists|Baptist]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England ministers preached loyalty to the King.<ref name="Nelson1961">William H. Nelson, ''The American Tory'' (1961) p. 186</ref> Religious motivation for fighting tyranny reached across socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor, men and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.<ref name="Bonomi"/>

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract ideal of republican government that included hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that British liberties relied on the balance of power between these three social orders, maintaining the hierarchical deference to the privileged class.<ref>Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 273-4, 299–300</ref> Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] wrote that: {{quote|"Puritanism … and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification” by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all can be saved.".<ref>Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) p. 303</ref>}}

===Controversial British legislation===
The Revolution was in some ways incited by a number of pieces of legislation originating from the British Parliament that, for Americans, were illegitimate acts of a government that had no right to pass laws on Englishmen in the Americas who did not have elected representation in that government. For the British, policy makers saw these laws as necessary to rein in colonial subjects who, in the name of economic development that was designed to benefit the home nation, had been allowed near-autonomy for too long.

The British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was usually illegal. That is,  American merchants were not allowed to trade with the French, Dutch or Spanish empires. Britain implemented mercantilism through the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, "Then and there the child Independence was born."<ref name="Stephens2006">Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>

In 1762, Patrick Henry argued the [[Parson's Cause]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where the legislature had passed a law and it was vetoed by the king. Henry argued, "that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience".<ref name = "Miller1943">Miller (1943)</ref>

Following their victory in the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, Great Britain took control of the French holdings in North America, outside the Caribbean. The British sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French, and keep them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp 92-98 </ref> Disregarding the proclamation, some groups of settlers continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W.

====1764–1766: More provocative legislation====
{{Main|Sugar Act|Currency Act|Quartering Acts|Stamp Act 1765|Declaratory Act}}
{{See|No taxation without representation|Virtual representation}}

Britain did not expect the colonies to contribute to the interest or the retirement of debt incurred during its wars, but they did expect a portion of the expenses for colonial defense to be paid by the Americans. Estimating the expenses of defending the continental colonies and the [[British West Indies]] to be approximately £200,000 annually, the British goal after the end of this war was that the colonies would be taxed for £78,000 of this amount. The colonists objected chiefly on the grounds not that the taxes were high (they were low)<ref>Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1943) p. 89</ref> but that they had no representation in the Parliament. Parliament insisted it had the right to levy any tax without colonial approval, to demonstrate that it had authority over the colonies.<ref>Middlekauff p. 62</ref>

The colonists did not object to the principle of contributing to the cost of their defense (colonial legislatures spent large sums raising and outfitting militias during the French and Indian War), but they disputed the need for the Crown to station regular British troops in North America. In the absence of a French threat, colonists believed the colonial militias (which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures) to be sufficient. Officer positions were in high demand among the British aristocracy—the rank of captain or major sold for thousands of pounds, and could be resold once an officer purchased an even higher rank.<ref name="Shy, Toward Lexington 2008">Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' (2008) pp 69-73</ref> The British wanted all the commissions for themselves, and were unwilling to commission colonial officers who would pay nothing for their commissions, nor would they recognize colonial commissions, effectively negating the will or the legal authority of the colonies to contribute to defense in that sort of way. With some 1,500 well-connected British officers who would have become redundant in the aftermath of the Seven Years War, London would have had to discharge them if they did not assign them to North America.<ref>Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' 73-78</ref> Therefore the main reason for Parliament imposing taxes was to prove its supremacy, and the main use of the tax funds would be patronage for ambitious British officers.<ref>Bernhard Knollenberg, ''Origin of the American Revolution: 1759-1766'' (1960) pp 76-87</ref> The slogan "[[No taxation without representation]]" summed up the American position. London responded that [[virtual representation|the colonists were "virtually represented"]]; but most Americans rejected this.<ref>William S. Carpenter, "Taxation Without Representation" in ''Dictionary of American History, Volume 7'' (1976); Miller (1943)</ref>

In 1764, Parliament enacted the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Currency Act]], further vexing the colonists. Protests led to a powerful new weapon, the systematic [[boycott]] of British goods. The following year, the British enacted the [[Quartering Acts]], which required British soldiers to be quartered at the expense of residents in certain areas. Colonists objected to this, as well.

In 1765 the Stamp Act was the first [[direct tax]] levied on the colonies by British Prime Minister [[George Grenville]] and the Parliament. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets— decks of playing cards—were required to have the stamps. The colonists still considered themselves loyal subjects of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]], with the same historic rights and obligations as subjects in Britain.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 11</ref>
Nevertheless, representatives of all 13 colonies protested vehemently, as popular leaders such as Patrick Henry in Virginia and James Otis in Massachusetts, rallied the people in opposition. A secret group, the "[[Sons of Liberty]]" formed in many towns and threatened violence if anyone sold the stamps, and no one did.<ref>Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution'' (1991) pp. 77-112</ref> In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice-admiralty court and looted the home of the chief justice, [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a "[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen]]. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise. In London, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham]] government came to power and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax, but in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 insisted that parliament retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".<ref name = "Miller1943"/>

====1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act====

In 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]], which placed a tax on a number of essential goods including paper, glass, and tea. Angered at the tax increases, colonists organized a boycott of British goods. In Boston on March 5, 1770, a large mob gathered around a group of British soldiers. The mob grew more and more threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks and debris at the soldiers. One soldier was clubbed and fell. All but one of the soldiers fired into the crowd. Eleven people were hit; three civilians were killed at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. Although the soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), the widespread descriptions soon became propaganda to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This in turn began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.<ref>Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1996)</ref>[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

In June 1772, in what became known as the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations was burned by American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]]. Soon afterward, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts reported that he and the royal judges would be paid directly from London, thus bypassing the colonial legislature.

On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], boarded the ships of the government-favored [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped an estimated £10,000 worth of tea from its holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into the harbor. This event became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.<ref>Benjamin L. Carp, ''Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America'' (2010)</ref>

{{Main|Quebec Act|Intolerable Acts}}

The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 extended [[Quebec]]'s boundaries to the [[Ohio River]], shutting out the claims of the thirteen colonies. By then, however, the Americans had little regard for new laws from London; they were drilling militia and organizing for war.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 15</ref>

The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.<ref>Miller (1943) pp. 353–76</ref> The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second Act, the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]], ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party (the British never received such a payment). The fourth Act was the Quartering Acts of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.

[[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] argued in 1775 for the British position that Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence.<ref>Miller, p.89</ref> The colonists countered that North's argument failed to take into consideration the taxes collected by colonial governments. The colonists believed, especially considering the economic restraints the British were keen to enforce in the colonies, that any additional tax burden from London was excessive.

===American political opposition===
{{See|Suffolk Resolves|Declaration of Rights and Grievances|Continental Association|Petition to the King (1774)|Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Conciliatory Resolution|Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms|Olive Branch Petition|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}

American political opposition was initially through the colonial assemblies such as the Stamp Act Congress, which included representatives from across the colonies. In 1765, the [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed which used public demonstrations, violence and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. While openly hostile to what they considered an oppressive Parliament acting illegally, colonists persisted in numerous petitions and pleas for intervention from a monarch to whom they still claimed loyalty. In late 1772, after the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all thirteen colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. In early 1773 Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22–24</ref>

A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on Committees Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities—the Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British good. They promoted patriotism and home manufacturing, advising Americans to avoid luxuries, and lead a more simple life. The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life. They set up espionage networks to identify disloyal elements, displaced the royal officials, and helped topple the entire Imperial system in each colony. In late 1774 in early 1775, they supervised the elections of provincial conventions, which took over the actual operation of colonial government.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp 144-145</ref>

In response to the ''Massachusetts Government Act'', Massachusetts and other colonies formed local governments called [[Provincial Congress]]es. In 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened, consisting of representatives from each of the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. Standing [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]] were created by each Provincial Congress or equivalent for the enforcement of the resolutions by the Committee of Correspondence, Provincial Congress, and the Continental Congress. British colonies in North America that did not have government responsible to its people did not join the Continental Congress, but remained loyal to the Crown. These colonies included [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]], [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]].

==Factions==
The population of the Thirteen Colonies was far from homogeneous, particularly in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely not only within regions and communities, but also within families and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

===King George III===
The war became a personal issue for the king, fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, "'If Others Will Not Be Active, I must Drive': George III and the American Revolution." ''Early American Studies'' 2004 2(1): pp 1-46. P. D. G. Thomas, "George III and the American Revolution." ''History'' 1985 70(228): 16-31, says the king played a minor role before 1775.</ref>

===Patriots===
{{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}}
{{See|Sons of Liberty}}
At the time, revolutionaries were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans". They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.

====Role of women====
[[File:Abigail Adams.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Abigail Adams|[[Abigail Adams]]]]
{{Main|Women in the American Revolution}}

Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]] fighting disguised as men. Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed the armies and their families.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60">Berkin, ''Revolutionary Mothers'' (2006) p. 59-60</ref>

The boycott of British goods required the willing participation of American women.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 41</ref> the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to spinning and weaving—skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [[Middletown, Massachusetts]] wove {{convert|20522|yd|m|0}} of cloth.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60"/>

A crisis of political loyalties could also disrupt the fabric of colonial America women’s social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman’s loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.<ref>Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6</ref><ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)</ref>

====Psychology and class ====
Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:
:"The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people....This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution."<ref>John Ferling, ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'' (2002) p. 281</ref>

To understand the Patriots historians have examined their hearts and minds, comparing their psychology with that of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. Historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] has identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits characterized the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5">Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164-5</ref> Loyalists were older, better established, and resisted innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side. Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and became angry when pressured by the Patriots to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire). Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually but wanted to delay the inevitable, fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.<ref>Hull et al, ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344–66</ref><ref>Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167–305</ref> Labaree also writes that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5"/>

Historians, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]] in the early 20th century, examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence that there was a class war inside the revolution.<ref>J. Franklin Jameson, ''The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement'' (1926); other historians pursuing the same line of thought included [[Charles Beard]], [[Carl Becker]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]].</ref> In the last 50 years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity.<ref>Wood, "Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution" (1966) pp. 3–32</ref> Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army. Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means of freeing themselves from British oppression and taxation and, above all, reasserting what they considered to be their rights. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause as well, demanding more political equality. They were especially successful in the Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the "absurd democratical notions" it proposed.<ref>Nash (2005)</ref><ref>Resch (2006)</ref>

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}

While there is no way of knowing the actual numbers, historians have estimated that about 15–20% of the population remained loyal to the British Crown; these were known at the time as "Loyalists", "Tories", or "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it.<ref name="Calhoon, 1992 p. 235">Calhoon, ''Loyalism and Neutrality'' (1992) p. 235</ref> Loyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, often connected to the [[Church of England]], and included many established merchants with business connections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston. The revolution sometimes divided families; for example, the Franklins. [[William Franklin]], son of Benjamin Franklin and governor of the [[Province of New Jersey]] remained Loyal to the Crown throughout the war and never spoke to his father again. Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more striking examples of this, see [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]].<ref name="Calhoon, 1992 p. 235"/>

After the war, the great majority of the 450,000–500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some, such as [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]], became prominent American leaders. Estimates vary, but about 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada, and others to Britain (7,000) or to Florida or the [[West Indies]] (9,000). This made up approximately 2% of the total population of the colonies.<ref name="Pole 1994">Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 20–22</ref> When Loyalists left the [[Southern United States|South]] in 1783, they took thousands of blacks with them as slaves to the British West Indies.<ref name="Pole 1994"/>

===Neutrals===
A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile. However, the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], especially in Pennsylvania, were the most important group that was outspoken for neutrality. As Patriots declared independence, the Quakers, who continued to do business with the British, were attacked as supporters of British rule, "contrivers and authors of seditious publications" critical of the revolutionary cause.<ref>Gottlieb 2005</ref>

==Other participants==
===Spain===
Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid]], general of the Spanish forces in [[New Spain]] who also served as governor of Louisiana was sent to Florida at the head of an expedition of colonial troops to aid the American colonists in their rebellion against Britain <ref>Edward F. Butler, "Spain's Involvement in the American Revolutionary War" ''The SAR Magazine'' Vol. 104 No. 1</ref> The importance of Galvez's campaign from the American perspective was that he denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south, and kept open a vital conduit for supplies.<ref>Thompson, Buchanan Parker, ''Spain: Forgotten Ally of the American Revolution'' North Quincy, Mass.: Christopher Publishing House, 1976.</ref>

===France===
In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions. A [[dummy corporation]] run by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] concealed their activities. Americans obtained some munitions through [[Holland]] as well as French and Spanish ports in the [[West Indies]].<ref>Jonathan Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1985) pp. 57–65</ref>

===Native Americans===
Most [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported the King. The tribes that depended most heavily upon colonial trade tended to side with the revolutionaries, though political factors were important as well. The most prominent Native American leader siding with the King was [[Joseph Brant]] of the [[Mohawk nation]], who led frontier raids on isolated settlements in Pennsylvania and [[Province of New York|New York]] until an American army under [[John Sullivan]] secured New York in 1779, forcing the Loyalist Indians into Canada.<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref>

The great majority of the 200,000 Native Americans east of the Mississippi distrusted the colonists and supported the British cause.<ref>Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref> Even though there was no major Native American participation during the war, the British provided funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in participating yet again in a European conflict. A few supported the American cause.<ref>Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)</ref>

The British provided arms for the Indians, under Loyalist leadership, to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York, threatening to massacre the settlers, especially in Pennsylvania. The most prominent was Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, who led a band of 300 Indian warriors and 100 white loyalists in 1778 and 1780 multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania.<ref>see Barbara Graymont, "Thayendanegea", [http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=36808&amp;query=joseph%20AND%20brant ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']</ref> In 1776 Cherokee war parties attacked all along the southern frontier.<ref>Tom Hatley, ''The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution'' (1993); James H. O'Donnell, III, ''Southern Indians in the American Revolution'' (1973)</ref>

While the Cherokee could launch raids numbering a couple hundred warriors, as seen in the [[Chickamauga Wars]], they could not mobilize enough forces to fight a major invasion without allies. In 1779 Washington sent General John Sullivan with four brigades of Continental soldiers to drive the Iroquois out of upstate western New York. There was little combat but Sullivan systematically burned 40 (empty) Indian villages and, most important, destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that comprised the winter food supply. Facing starvation the Iroquois permanently fled to the Niagara Falls area and to Canada, where the British fed them.<ref>Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July–September 1779'' (1997).</ref>

At the peace conference the British abandoned their Indian allies, and the Americans took possession of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:
:Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.<ref>Calloway (1995) p. 290</ref>

The British, however, did not give up their forts in the west until 1796 and kept alive the dream of one day forming a satellite Indian nation in what is now the Ohio to Wisconsin part of the Midwest. That goal was one of the causes of the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Dwight L. Smith, "A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 1989 61(2–4): 46–63</ref><ref>Francis M. Carroll, [http://books.google.com/books?id=1AjlS20Q5J8C&amp;pg=PA24 ''A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783–1842''] (2001) p. 23</ref>

===Slaves===
Some African-American slaves became politically active and supported the King, especially in Virginia where the royal governor actively recruited black men into the British forces in return for [[manumission]], protection for their families, and the promise of land grants. Following the war, many of these "[[Black Loyalist]]s" settled in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], and many then moved to [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]], where the descendants of some remain today.<ref>Hill (2007), see also [http://www.blackloyalist.com/ blackloyalist.com]</ref>

Some slaves understood Revolutionary rhetoric as promising freedom and equality. Both British and American governments made promises of freedom for service and some slaves fought in one or the other armies. Starting in 1777 abolition occurred in the North, usually on a gradual schedule with no payments to the owners, but slavery persisted in the South and took on new life after 1790.<ref>Benjamin Quarles, ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961)</ref>

During the Revolution, efforts were made by the British to turn slavery against the Americans,<ref name="Revolutionary War: The Home Front">[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/amrev/homefrnt/homefrnt.html Revolutionary War: The Home Front], The Library of Congress</ref> but historian David Brion Davis explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves: {{quote|But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own West Indies, where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave insurrections. The British elites also understood that an all-out attack on one form of property could easily lead to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order, as envisioned by radical religious sects in Britain’s seventeenth-century civil wars.<ref>Davis p. 148</ref>}}

Davis underscored the British dilemma: "Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure".<ref>Davis p. 149</ref> The colonists accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.<ref>Schama p.28-30 p. 78-90</ref>

American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for their hypocritical calls for freedom, while many of their leaders were slave-holders. [[Samuel Johnson]] snapped, "how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?"<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 7</ref> Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation about "the freeing of one Negro" ([[Somersett's Case|Somersett]]) while they continued to permit the [[Slave Trade]].<ref>Schama p.75</ref>

[[Phyllis Wheatley]], a black poet who popularized the image of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to represent America, came to public attention when her ''Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral'' appeared in 1773<ref name="Hochschild p.50-51">Hochschild p.50-51</ref>

==Military hostilities begin==

{{See|Shot heard round the world|Boston campaign|Invasion of Canada (1775)}}

The [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Battle of Lexington and Concord]] took place April 19, 1775, when the British sent a force of roughly 1000 troops to confiscate arms and arrest revolutionaries in Concord, Massachusetts.<ref>Morrisey p.35</ref> They clashed with the local militia, marking the first fighting of the American Revolutionary War. The news aroused the 13 colonies to call out their militias and send troops to [[Siege of Boston|besiege Boston]]. The [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] followed on June 17, 1775. While a British victory, it was at a great cost; about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.<ref>Harvey. ''"A few bloody noses"'' (2002) pp. 208-210</ref><ref>Urban p.74</ref>

The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775, after the war had started. The Congress created the [[Continental Army]] and extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation. King George III refused to receive it, issuing instead the [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], requiring action against the "traitors".

In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]]. General [[Richard Montgomery]] captured [[Montreal]] but a joint [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attack on Quebec]] with the help of [[Benedict Arnold]] failed.

In March 1776, with George Washington as the commander of the new army, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]]. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. While there still were many Loyalists, they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.<ref>Miller (1948) p. 87</ref>

===Prisoners===
{{Main|Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War}}
In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. The British government at first started treating captured rebel combatants as common criminals and preparations were made to bring them to trial for treason. American Secretary [[Lord Germain]] and First Lord of the Admiralty [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] were especially eager to do so, with a particular emphasis on those who had previously served in British units (and thereby sworn an oath of allegiance to the crown).

Many of the prisoners taken by the British at Bunker Hill apparently expected to be hanged, but British authorities declined to take the next step: treason trials and executions. The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists. After the surrender at Saratoga in October 1777, furthermore, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Therefore no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than combat operations.<ref>Larry G. Bowman, ''Captive Americans: Prisoners During the American Revolution'' (1976)</ref> At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Triumph of Freedom, 1775–1783'' (1948) p. 166.</ref>

==Finance==
Britain's war against the Americans, French and Spanish cost about £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money it needed.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) pp. 81, 119</ref> Heavy spending brought France to the [[Causes of the French Revolution#Economics and finances|verge of bankruptcy and revolution]], while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers. Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London The efficient British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.<ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688-1783'' (1990) p 91</ref>

In sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war.<ref>Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) pp 23-44</ref> In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.<ref>Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp 225-52</ref>

Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp 586-589</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775-1780, and in 1780-81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless—but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200 million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.<ref>Ralph Volney Harlow, "Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775-1783," ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 35, No. 1 (Oct., 1929), pp. 46-68 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]</ref> The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages—usually in arrears—declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.

Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775-1783'' (1990)</ref>

Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed and 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776-1790'' (1961)</ref>

==Creating new state constitutions==
Following the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, the Patriots had control of most of Massachusetts; the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive. In all thirteen colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving British governors, agents and supporters from their homes. They had elected conventions and "legislatures" that existed outside of any legal framework; new constitutions were used in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared they were states now, not colonies.<ref name = "Pole-ch29">Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29</ref>

On January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution, six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Then, in May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.<ref>Nevins (1927)</ref>

The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create, they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process, such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York and Massachusetts, the results were constitutions that featured:
* Substantial property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications);<ref name = "Pole-ch29"/>
* [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower;
* Strong [[governor]]s, with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority;
* Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government;
* The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]].
 [[File:Benjamin Rush Painting by Peale 1783.jpg|thumb|alt=Benjamin Rush, 1783|[[Benjamin Rush]], 1783]]
In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power—especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire—the resulting constitutions embodied
* universal white manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later);
* strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]];
* relatively weak governors, without veto powers, and little appointing authority;
* prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts;

Whether conservatives or radicals held sway in a state did not mean that the side with less power accepted the result quietly. The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only fourteen years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal white-male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.<ref name="Wood, 1992"/>

==Independence and Union==

{{See|Lee Resolution|Articles of Confederation|Committee of Five|United States Declaration of Independence}}

In May Congress called on all the states to write constitutions, and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule. In April the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] issued the [[Halifax Resolves]], explicitly authorized its delegates to vote for independence.<ref>Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation'' (1968) pp. 678-9</ref>

By June nine colonies were ready for independence; one by one the last four—Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and New York—fell into line. [[Richard Henry Lee]] was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776.  On the 11th a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain.  After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The  [[Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and presented by the committee, was slightly revised and unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4, marking the formation of a new nation, which called itself the [[United States of America]].<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41-46</ref>

The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, the "Articles of Confederation," for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, and immediately began operating under their terms. The Articles were formally ratified on March 1, 1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and on the following day a new government of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]] took its place, with [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] as presiding officer.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 30</ref><ref>Klos, ''President Who?

===British return: 1776–1777===
{{See|New York and New Jersey campaign|Staten Island Peace Conference|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}

After Washington forced the British out of Boston in spring 1776, neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army at the [[Battle of Brooklyn]] in August, one of the largest engagements of the war. After the Battle of Brooklyn, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities. A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met Howe on [[Staten Island]] in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]]. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended until 1781. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured General Washington. They made the city their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]]. New York City consequently became the destination for Loyalist refugees, and a focal point of Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].<ref>Schecter, Barnet. ''The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution''. (2002)</ref><ref>McCullough, ''1776'' (2005)</ref> The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania, but in a surprise attack in late December 1776 Washington [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossed the Delaware River]] back into New Jersey and defeated Hessian and British armies at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], thereby regaining New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to pro-independence supporters at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.[[File:Washington Praying 1928 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|185px|Washington at Valley Forge, issue of 1928]]

In 1777, as part of a grand strategy to end the war, the British sent an invasion force from Canada to seal off New England, which the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. In a major case of mis-coordination, the British army in New York City went to Philadelphia which it captured from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] waited in vain for reinforcements from New York, and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15 a pivotal [[siege]] at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania distracted British troops and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].

===American alliances after 1778===
{{See|France in the American Revolutionary War|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}

The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress, as Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] were signed between the United States and France.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28">Hamilton, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'' (1974) p. 28</ref> [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America, and unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathised with colonial grievances now turned against the American rebels for allying with British international rival and enemy.<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 151</ref>

Later Spain (in 1779) and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war.<ref>Mackesy, ''The War for America'' (1993) p. 568</ref> The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were considered more valuable.

Because of the alliance with France and the deteriorating military situation, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], the British commander, evacuated Philadelphia to reinforce New York City. General Washington attempted to intercept the retreating column, resulting in the [[Battle of Monmouth|Battle of Monmouth Court House]], the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83">Higginbotham, ''The War of American Independence'' (1983) p. 83</ref>

===The British move South, 1778–1783===
{{See|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War}}

The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern colonies. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the "southern strategy" as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.<ref>Crow and Tise, ''The Southern Experience in the American Revolution'' (1978) p. 157-9</ref>

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and controlled the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] coastline. In 1780 they launched a fresh invasion and [[Siege of Charleston|took Charleston]] as well. A significant victory at the [[Battle of Camden]] meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping the Loyalists would rally to the flag. Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them much of the territory they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic [[guerrilla war]], fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains the British had previously made.<ref>Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)</ref>

====Yorktown 1781====
[[File:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|alt=The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, paving the way for the end of the American Revolutionary War|The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, marking effective British defeat]]
{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}

The southern British army marched to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet which would take them back to New York.<ref>Harvey p.493-95</ref> When that fleet was defeated by a French fleet at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], the southern British army became trapped at Yorktown.<ref>Harvey p.502-06</ref> In October 1781 under a combined siege by the French and Continental armies under Washington, the British, under the command of General Cornwallis, surrendered their second army of the war.  Cornwallis refused to attend the surrender ceremonies and sent a subordinate.<ref>Harvey p.515</ref>

====The war winds down====
Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the rebels, but now it reached a new low.<ref>Harvey p.528</ref> Although King George III personally wanted to fight on, his supporters lost control of Parliament, and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83"/><ref>A final naval battle was fought on March 10, 1783 by Captain [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] and the crew of the [[USS Alliance (1778)|USS ''Alliance'']], who defeated three British warships led by HMS ''Sybille''. Martin I. J. Griffin, ''The Story of Commodore John Barry'' (2010) pp 218-23</ref>

Washington could not know that after Yorktown the British would not reopen hostilities. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782-83.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''The French Navy and American Independence'' (1975) p. 248</ref> The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible ''coup d'état''. The unrest among officers of the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.<ref>Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783-1802'' (1975) pp 17-39</ref>

==Peace treaty==
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}

The peace treaty with Britain, known as the Treaty of Paris, gave the U.S. all land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, though not including Florida (On September 3, 1783, Britain entered into a separate agreement with Spain under which Britain ceded Florida back to Spain.) The British abandoned the Indian allies living in this region; they were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795.<ref>Miller (1948), pp. 616–48</ref> Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their business flourished.

===Impact on Britain===
Losing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when it discovered it suddenly faced powerful enemies, with no allies, and dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a powerful crisis, 1776-1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.<ref>William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)</ref><ref>Jeremy Black, ''George III: America’s Last King''(2006)</ref>

==Immediate aftermath==
After the war finally ended in 1783, there was a period of prosperity, with the entire world at peace. The national government, still operating under the Articles of Confederation was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into the new lands, and Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee became states in the 1790s.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. ''Companion to the American Revolution,'' pp. 557-624</ref> However, that Congress had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations and bankers, or to Americans who had been given billions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists, led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other veterans, feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts. Calling themselves "Federalists," the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.<ref>Richard B. Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781-1789'' (1987) pp 245-266</ref> It drafted a new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] that provided for a much stronger federal government, with a powerful president and was ratified in 1788.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781-1789'' pp 300-13</ref> The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789'' pp 300-22</ref>

===Interpretations===
Interpretations about the effect of the Revolution vary. Though contemporary participants referred to the events as "the revolution",<ref>David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2001)</ref> at one end of the spectrum is the view that the American Revolution was not "revolutionary" at all, contending that it did not radically transform colonial society but simply replaced a distant government with a local one.<ref>Greene, ''The American Revolution'' (2000) pp. 93-102</ref> More recent scholarship pioneered by historians such as [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]], and [[Edmund Morgan]] accepts the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound impact on world affairs, based on an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the period, and republicanism. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.<ref>Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)</ref>

===Loyalist expatriation===
About 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic; some left for Britain and the remainder, called [[United Empire Loyalists]] received British subsidies to resettle in British colonies in North America, especially [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>W. Stewart Wallace, '';The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (Toronto, 1914) [http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm online edition]</ref> The new colonies of Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]] were created by Britain for their benefit. However, about 80% of the Loyalists stayed and became loyal citizens of the United States, and some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.<ref>Van Tine, ''American Loyalists'' (1902) p 307</ref>

===As an example or inspiration===
{{See|Atlantic Revolutions}}

After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible.<ref>Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 278-9</ref> The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Thus came the widespread assertion of liberty, individual rights, equality and hostility toward corruption which would prove core values of liberal republicanism to Americans. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of [[democracy|democratically]] elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with [[Direct election|directly elected]] representative government.<ref>Palmer, (1959)</ref>

The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain at that time, was the next country after France to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/> On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America]], signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/>

The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]] that took hold in the French Revolution, the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) ch 53–55</ref>

The Revolution had a strong, immediate impact in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. The Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the [[English Civil War]] (in the 17th century), was one of the first lessons in overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as [[Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence had some impact on the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49–52</ref><ref>Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)</ref>
The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804—long before the British Parliament acted in 1833 to abolish slavery in its colonies.<ref>Greene and Pole p. 409, 453-54</ref>

===National debt===
{{See|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}

The national debt after the American Revolution fell into three categories. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners—mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.

The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.<ref>Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379</ref> In 1790, at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million. Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.<ref>Joseph J. Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004) p 204</ref>

<title>American flag sort</title>
<text>An '''[[American flag]] sort''' is an efficient, [[in-place]] variant of [[Sorting_algorithm#Radix_sort|radix sort]] that distributes items into hundreds of [[Bucket_%28computing%29|buckets]]. The first step counts the number of items in each bucket, and the second step computes where each bucket will start in the [[array data structure|array]]. The last step cyclically [[Permutation|permutes]] items to their proper bucket. Since the buckets are in order in the array, there is no collection step. The name comes by [[analogy]] with the [[Dutch national flag]] problem in the last step: efficiently [[Partition of a set|partition]] the array into many "stripes". Using some efficiency techniques, it is twice as fast as [[quicksort]] for large sets of [[String_%28computer_science%29|strings]].

Note: This works especially well when sorting a byte at a time, using 256 buckets.

<title>AmiZilla</title>
<text>'''AmiZilla''' was an ongoing project which tried to port the [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser - and other Mozilla projects - to [[AmigaOS]], [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]], and to fund efforts for achieving that goal.

==History==
This project started in May 2003 from an idea of [[DiscreetFX]], a firm based in United States (Chicago, [[Illinois]]) which supports still existing Amiga [[Video Toaster]] market and produces and sells programs and Digital/FX sample collections for amateur, professional and broadcast studios customers. The AmiZilla project started in the form of [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] contest (i.e. donors uses internet online funding &amp;money-transfer resources like [[PayPal]] to donate a free amount of money, which will be collected as a whole "booty" sum of money and then used to "pay" the person or the team who proves himself to be capable of realizing the whole project). The project was announced on Amigaworld Portal on 19 May 2003 with an amount of 1000 US Dollars<ref name="Announcement">{{Cite web| title = Announce of starting of AmiZilla Project at Amigaworld.net site | url = http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=500 | publisher=DiscreetFx and AmigaWorld.net site | accessdate = May 19, 2003}}</ref>, and in only one day it collected 2000 dollars by donations, climbing from 1000 to 3000 dollars <ref name="OSNews">{{Cite web| title = Announcement on OSNews.com stating on May 20, 2003 that AmiZilla Project collected 3000 dollars | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/3604/3000_USD_for_First_Programmer_to_Port_Mozilla_to_AmigaOS | publisher=OSNews | accessdate = May 20, 2003}}</ref>. Noteworthy for a very little community of users, by the 11th of June 2003 it had reached more than 4000 US$, and this enormous effort, and the rapid rampage in collecting money by the Amiga users (who were considered a sparse community) was noted also by Mozillazine online news portal <ref name="Mozillazine">{{Cite web| title = Announcement on Mozillazine (and update of 11 june) | url = http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3262 | publisher=MozillaZine online news magazine | accessdate = June 7, 2003}}</ref>, and by Slashdot.org online magazine<ref name="Slashdot">{{Cite web| title = Slashdot news corner on June 11 | url = http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/06/11/128248.shtml | publisher=Slashdot magazine and The Rest ©, Geeknet, Inc. | accessdate = June 11, 2003}}</ref>.
As of 2007, a port of Mozilla's [[SpiderMonkey]] [[JavaScript]] engine was achieved, while a recompile of [[Netscape Portable Runtime|NSPR]] was in pre-alpha development. In the intentions of the support team, the future goals of the project included better support through the [[cairo (graphics)|cairo]] 2D graphics library which is slated for integration into the codebase of Firefox 3 (code-named Gran Paradiso), that was already ported to the Amiga platform. The AmiZilla project was closed November 19, 2009 without realizing significant results mainly due to the retirement of a contribution of $5,000 donated by a former Netscape executive who wanted to keep his anonymity and was tired of waiting for results that never come. The project during its entire life was capable to raise the noteworthy sum of $11,869.64 (as been evidenced in the page of donors at its site<ref name="Donors_Page">{{Cite web| title = Page of Donors at AmiZilla Project site | url = http://www.discreetfx.com/amizilla_donors.html | publisher=DiscreetFx | accessdate = August 10, 2008}}</ref>). Part of this amount of money was then transferred to [[TimberWolf Browser|TimberWolf]] browser bounty, and the main part of the money was given back to the former donors. The abrupt closing of the AmiZilla project caused a vaste echo in Amiga community and started a flamewar on Amiga community discussion sites, due to the fact that just some day before Amizilla Project ceased its operations, it were released to public the first screenshots of TimberWolf Browser by Friedens bothers. Some members of the Amiga community thought Timberwolf should be considered as the candidate to win the whole booty amount of money collected by the AmiZilla Project<ref name="Flamewar">{{Cite web| title = Announce of ending of AmiZilla Project at Amigaworld.net site | url = http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5159 | publisher=DiscreetFx and AmigaWorld.net site | accessdate = November 20, 2009}}</ref>. But many others disagreed since Timberwolf had its own Bounty, set of rules and requirements and was only for Amiga OS 4.1.

==Rules==
There were some main rules for AmiZilla project to be accomplished by those developers who wanted to achieve the full prize bounty. The main rule was the fact that Amizilla should be a porting of any of the Mozilla/Firefox browsers into Amiga platform, and it should be an Open Source project. the code should be made freely available to any Amiga developer, and easily ported (with any obvious obliged differences) to any actually existing Amiga system such as AROS, AmigaOS 3 for [[Motorola]] 680XX family of processors, [[AmigaOS 4]] for PPC family of processors and MorphOS. The project should be realized in C or C++ to grant an easy porting of the code on every platform, and the money had had being divided up to the winning team based on how much work each team member had effectively realized (for example if the anonymous person "Joe Developer" had realized 70% of the coding he had got 70% of the booty). The fact the project had to be multi-platform, and aimed at supporting all the major Amiga operating systems at the same time was the main cause of its lack of success. No any single Amiga developer could had started coding for AmiZilla as a one-man job because the effort to realize a porting of Firefox on all the Amiga systems, it should had been truly an enormous task to be accomplished, and also it was difficult to start a joined team development with various people skilled at the three main Amiga systems due to never dormant grudges that afflicted the Amiga community, that was and still is divided into three main branches (AmigaOS, AROS, MorphOS) and any branch had its loyal supporters.

==Results of the AmiZilla project==
Despite of its apparent lack of success, the AmiZilla Bounty Project inspired many bounty systems that were created upon AmiZilla's example. It lead a great rampage in Amiga for the funding of any software project and help developers to gain a concrete (or even symbolic) amount of money to get a revenue for their efforts in creating or porting software for Amiga platforms. After AmiZilla there were created bounties for AROS, MorphOS and AmigaOS. Almost the whole AROS Operating System was created by hiring bounties, and also there are still ongoing MorphOS Bounty Projects like [http://www.power2people.org/ "Power2People"], or the "Amigabounty.net" for AmigaOS, etc.,etc. The whole Amiga community learned from AmiZilla how to fund the programmers that still work for this computing platform and helping to develop the software that it is needed in Amiga to live on and continue any further software development for this platform.

==Other Firefox Projects==
A separate effort to port Firefox to AmigaOS 4 was started in early 2009 and still ongoing. It is named "Project [[TimberWolf Browser|Timberwolf]]". Screen shots and more information about Timberwolf was made public in November 2009, some days before AmiZilla project was closed abruptly, and then, on June 9, 2010, Timberwolf succeeded in its task to porting Firefox on Amiga OS and in fact an Alpha version was made available for free download on pages the Project Timberwolf site<ref name="FriedenHQ">{{Cite web| title = Announce of Timberwolf Alpha 1 Release | url = http://www.friedenhq.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49:timberwolf&amp;catid=35:amigaos | publisher=Thomas Frieden and Hans-Joerg Frieden | accessdate = June 9, 2010}}</ref>. Users of AmigaOS have to get AmigaOS 4.1 Update 2 installed in order to run Timberwolf/Firefox.

'''Amiram Harten''' (1947 &amp;ndash; 1994) was an [[United States|American]]/[[Israelis|Israeli]] [[applied mathematician]]. Harten made fundamental contribution to the development of [[high-resolution scheme]]s for the solution of [[hyperbolic partial differential equations]]. Among other contributions, he developed the [[total variation diminishing]] scheme, which gives an oscillation free solution for flow with [[Shock wave|shocks]].<ref>{{Citation

[[Image:Amiga Logo 1985.svg|right|thumb|265px|The former Amiga logo, as used by Commodore-Amiga Inc.]]
[[Image:Amiga 1000DP.jpg|thumb|265px|The [[Amiga 1000]] (1985) was the first model released.]]

The '''Amiga''' was a family of [[personal computer]]s sold by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In [[North America]] success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars | title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures | author=Jeremy Reimer | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref> Second generation Amiga systems ([[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and [[Amiga 4000|A4000]]) were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[fourth generation game console]]s and [[IBM PC compatible]]s.

Based on the [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68000 series]] of [[microprocessor]]s, the machine sports a [[original Amiga chipset|custom chipset]] with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] [[operating system]] (now known as [[AmigaOS]]).

The Amiga was particularly popular for gaming and [[demoscene]] activities. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to affordable video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. It was also a less expensive alternative to the [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM-PC]] as a general-purpose business or home computer. The Amiga's native ability to play back several channels of digital samples made it a popular platform for early "[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]" music software, and the machine's relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]] and [[Aladdin 4D]]. The Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software, although early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine.<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=PsJ0ZZMuEQs YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - ''Celebrities''</ref><ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=ludrX2s1ZuM YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - TV spot version of 20-minute presentation</ref>

Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line. [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005. A-Cube sell the Amiga compatible [[Sam440]] PowerPC board with the [[AmigaOS 4.1]].

The name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers specifically from the Spanish word for a female friend,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/ahistory.html | title=The Twists and Turns of the Amiga Saga | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref><!--NB yes there are several other languages that use the same word, but the Amiga developers only knew Spanish and so that's the derivation. Please don't add a list of other languages here --> and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also gave the message that the Amiga computer line was 'user friendly' as a sort of pun or play on words.<ref>DeMaria and Wilson (2003) ''High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games'' p. 109 ISBN 0-07-223172-6</ref>

{{Main|History of the Amiga}}

{{Rquote|left|"The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody--including Commodore's marketing department--could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.<br />--''[[Byte Magazine]],'' August 1994}}
[[Image:Amiga-90sLogo.gif|right|thumb|200px|Logo used by Commodore in the US during the late 1980s]]
[[Image:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|right|265px|Amiga Technologies Logo. (1996)]]

Development of the Amiga began in 1982 with [[Jay Miner]] as the principal hardware designer of [[Amiga Corporation]]. It was initially intended to be a next generation [[video game]] machine, but was later redesigned as a general purpose computer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amigau.com/aig/prototypes/lorraine.html | title=Amiga Lorraine | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.amigaforever.com/games/ AmigaForever.com<!-- Bot generated title -->], Amiga Forever - Amiga Games</ref> In order to bring the design to market [[Commodore International]] bought Amiga Corporation and funded development. The first model was released in 1985 as simply "The Amiga from Commodore", later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]. The following year the Amiga product line was expanded with the introduction of two new models; the [[Amiga 2000]] for high-end graphics and business use, and the [[Amiga 500]] for home use. Commodore later released other Amiga models, both for low-end gaming use and high-end productivity use.

In 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[68060]] version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997. The Amiga brand was then sold to another PC manufacturer, [[Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to make hardware using the Amiga brand to a UK computer vendor Eyetech Group, Ltd. selling the [[AmigaOne]] via an international dealer network. The AmigaOne is a [[PowerPC]] computer to run [[AmigaOS 4]].

In October 2009, Hyperion was granted an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.x]] in any form, on any medium and for any current or future hardware platform under the exclusive trademark “AmigaOS”.

== Hardware ==
At its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.

=== Central processing unit ===
<!-- Removed image: [[Image:Motorola PowerPC 604e 233MHz.jpg|75px|thumb|right|<small>[[PowerPC]] processor.</small>]] -->

The [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While the 68000 family has a [[32-bit]] design, the 68000 used in several early models is generally referred to as 16-bit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/oneamiga1.html | title = The One for 16-bit Games | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | first = Gareth | last = Knight | work = Amiga History Guide }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/s_snippe.htm | title = Amiga Reviews: Zzap 16-Bit Gaming|accessdate =2008-05-23}}</ref> The 68000 has a [[16-bit]] external [[data bus]] so must transfer 32 bits of data in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]] — all this is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The 68000 could address 16 MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[instruction pipeline]] facilities. Commodore's design choice to remain with the 68000 architecture ensured that code was backward-compatible across the Amiga line.

CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.

Towards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PowerPC]].<ref name="Haynie" >{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/haynie3drisc.html |title=CBM's Plans for the RISC-Chipset |author=Dave Haynie |date=1995.01.24 |quote=The initial schedule of 18 months was for the Hombre game machine hardware. There's no real OS here, just a library of routines, including a 3D package, which would probably be licensed. The Amiga OS was not to have run on this system in any form. |publisher=Gareth Knight |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> However, these ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[Kernel (computing)|micro-kernel]] and software.<ref>The Big Book of Amiga Hardware [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=154 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de], [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=225 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de]</ref> Later Amiga clones, such as the AmigaOne featured PowerPC processors only.

=== Custom chipset ===
The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several [[coprocessors]] which handle [[raster graphics]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s which performed tasks, such as, [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.

==== Graphics ====
[[Image:HAM6example.png|thumb|right|A 4096 color [[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989.]]

All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]) or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have 128, 256 and 262144 ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[Color depth#Truecolor|16.8 million colors]].
<!-- Something about retargetable graphic hardware here -->
The Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]'' — adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. Some frequent users of this ability included wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and 'desktop video'. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.

In 1988 the release of the Amiga A2024<ref>[http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=863 Commodore: A2024]</ref> [[monochrome]] monitor gave Amiga a choice of various high-resolution graphic modes when used with compatible graphic cards. Previous versions only supported PAL or NTSC display resolutions.

==== Sound ====
The sound chip, named Paula, supports four sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist limit]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga’s low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and very first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.

Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least ones.

The quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide DSP functions, multi-track direct-to-disk recording, multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the OS and software.

=== Kickstart firmware ===
{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}
Kickstart is the [[booting|bootstrap]] [[firmware]]. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of [[AmigaOS]] and then attempt to boot from a [[bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive.

The first production Amiga, the Amiga 1000, required Kickstart to be loaded first from floppy disk into 256 [[kilobyte|kB]] of RAM reserved for this purpose. Later models generally hold Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip, improving start-up times. Models can be upgraded by replacing the ROM. Like the Amiga 1000, early Amiga 3000 systems loaded Kickstart from hard (or floppy) disk as the machine was launched while AmigaOS 2.0 was still in [[software release cycle#Beta|beta]] development.

Several third-party vendors produced switchable socket doublers to allow two ROM chips to plug into the single ROM socket on the motherboard. These became popular as later Kickstart versions caused some backwards compatibility problems with earlier Amiga software titles. The effect of these switchable doublers was a convenient [[dual boot]] system, with a choice of two distinct OS versions via a pre-determined key sequence at reboot, or via a two way switch installed in the case, depending on the specific version installed.

=== Peripherals ===
The Amiga was one of the first home computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.

Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include genlocks, Ethernet cards, modems, sound cards and samplers, video digitizers, USB cards, extra serial ports, and IDE controllers.

The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device, particularly on big-box Amigas like the A2000, A3000 and A4000.

Early CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[floating point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] and [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.

Phase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[PowerUP (accelerator)#Blizzard PPC|Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time (and share the system memory). The PPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations (a powerful CPU is needed to run for example [[MAME]], but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time). It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC (project Linux APUS), but a PPC-native Amiga OS was not available when the PPC boards first appeared.

24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards are designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.

Perhaps the most famous video card in the North American market was the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]''. This was a powerful video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments. Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In PAL countries the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Timebase correction|time base correctors (TBCs)]] specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.

Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as Voodoo graphic cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, and TV tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.

PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.

Expansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See [[Amiga software]] for more information on these applications.

=== Networking ===
Amiga had three networking interface APIs:
* AS225 - Is the official Commodore TCP/IP stack [[Application programming interface|API]] with hardcoded drivers in revision 1 (AS225r1) for the [[AMD Lance Am7990|A2065 Ethernet]] and the A2060 Arcnet interfaces.<ref name="amigahi_netfaq_AmiTCP"/> In revision 2 (AS225r2) the SANA-II interface was used.
* SANA-II — Is a standardized API for hardware of network interfaces. It uses an inefficient buffer handling scheme, and lacks proper support for [[Promiscuous mode|promiscuous]] and [[multicast]] modes.
* Miami Network Interface (MNI) - Is an API that doesn't have the problems which SANA-II suffers from. It requires [[AmigaOS]] v2,04 or higher.

Different network media was used:

=== Commodore Amiga ===
[[Image:Amiga500 system.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 500]] (1987) was the best selling model.<ref>[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/sales.html AmigaHistory.co.uk<!-- Bot generated title -->], Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures</ref>]]
[[Image:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore.]]
The first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000 was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphics, video and audio capabilities. In 2006, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating "''Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer''".<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html PC World, The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time]</ref>

Following the A1000, Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.<ref>[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a500plus.html Commodore Amiga 500+]</ref>

The [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]] launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success.

Commodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Though discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe.

Following purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.

Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units, at least, had the words "B52/ROCK LOBSTER"<ref>[http://www.rollerfink.de/wp-content/rollerfink.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/img_1518.JPG RollerFink.de]</ref> [[Printed circuit board#Manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the popular song "[[Rock Lobster]]"  The [[Amiga 600]] referenced  "JUNE BUG" (after the song "Junebug") and the [[Amiga 1200]] had "CHANNEL Z" (after "[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]").<ref>{{cite web

=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===
{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}
[[Image:AmigaOS 4.1 Update 2.png|right|thumb|[[AmigaOS 4.1]] Update 2]]

AmigaOS 4 (OS4) is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems and currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, and on the PPC Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by Amiga Inc. AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006. Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.

AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007. The most recent release AmigaOS is 4.1.<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/amigaos41-ars.ars/5 It's alive!: Ars reviews AmigaOS 4.1], Ars Technica, September 22, 2008.</ref>

No new Amiga hardware has been released since the AmigaOne; however [[Acube Systems]] has entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.<ref>[http://www.acube-systems.biz/eng/news.php?id=35 ''OEM Version of AmigaOS 4.1 for Sam440ep imminent''], Acube Systems, September 17, 2008</ref> In 2009 version for [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Bplan|bPlan GmbH]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.<ref>[http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4740 ''AmigaOS 4.1 for Pegasos II''], Hyperion Entertainment, January 31, 2009</ref> Moreover, in 2009/2010, A-Eon Technology announced the [[AmigaOne X1000]].

=== Amiga hardware clones ===
Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=43 DraCo] [[Non-linear editing system|nonlinear video edit]] system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by Motorola's [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video I/O. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro II|ZORRO-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of 30 MB/sec transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|ZORRO-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.

In 1998, [[Index Information]] released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the [[Amiga 1200|A1200]], but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%"|5 1/4" drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs [[AmigaOS]] 3.1.

In 2006, two new Amiga-clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren.  Referred to as "new Amiga hardware",<ref name="minimig">[http://home.hetnet.nl/~weeren001/minimig.html HetNet.nl]</ref> the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and Gary chips as well as both 8520 CIA's and implements a simple version of Amber.  The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.<ref name="minimig"/>  The design for Minimig was released as Open Source on July 25, 2007. In February, 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for harddrive images. The minimig core is being ported to the FPGArcade "Replay" board. The Replay uses a larger FPGA which will support the AGA chipset and a 63030 soft core. The Replay board is designed to emulate many older computers and classic arcade machines.

The second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.<ref name="individual">[http://siliconsonic.de/news/news118_e.htm SiliconSonic.de]</ref>

=== Emulation ===
{{Main|Amiga emulation}}
Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been the target of various emulation projects so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[FPGA]] chips.<ref>[http://www.acube-systems.biz/index.php?page=news&amp;id=23 "Minimig available" announcement by Acube Systems]</ref>

One of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.

== Operating systems ==
=== AmigaOS ===
{{Main|AmigaOS}}
{{Rquote|left|"[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.<br />--''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine,'' October 1996.<ref>From PC Magazine, October 22, 1996
Inside Track By John C. Dvorak</ref>}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AmigaOS 3 9 Workbench.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Amiga OS 3.9]] -->

AmigaOS is a single-user [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Old versions (1.0-3.9) run on the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors, while the newer [[AmigaOS 4]] runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.<ref>[http://www.amiga.com/amigaos/ Amiga.com]</ref>

Another notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computer)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s with [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] and did not require [[file extension]]s.

The multi-tasking kernel was called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 kB of free memory.<ref name="cunningham_lee_amiga_exec">{{cite web |url=http://www.cunningham-lee.com/misc/amiga_exec.html|title=Byte Magazine on the Amiga Exec|accessdate=2008-04-12|last= Holloway|first= Tim}}</ref>

Like other operating systems of the time, the OS lacks [[memory protection]]. This was because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]] and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory.<ref name="google.groups.com (Memory Protection)">{{cite web|url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.advocacy/msg/7d0bf445a2c22d67?hl=en&amp;|title= Adding Memory Protection (MP) to the Amiga|work = groups.google.com|accessdate = December 30, 2006}}</ref> Although this speeds and eases [[interapplication communication]] (programs can communicate by simply passing a [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] back and forth), the lack of memory protection made the Amiga OS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]], and fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in [[AmigaOS 4]].

The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who cut their teeth on the Commodore 64 to [[Peek and Poke|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.

====Influences on other Operating Systems====

AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFlyBSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]] who is a former Amiga developer.<ref>[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2006-02/msg00087.html Re: User-Space Device Drivers], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 28 February 2006. Retrieved 1 February 2008.</ref><ref>[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2003-07/msg00049.html Re: You could do worse than Mach ports], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 17 July 2003. Retrieved 1 February 2008.</ref>

=== Unix and Unix-like systems ===
Commodore-Amiga produced [[Amiga Unix]], informally known as Amix, based on AT&amp;T [[UNIX System V|SVR4]]. It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and was included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with MMU such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.

There is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[Minix]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.<ref>[http://www.compwisdom.com/topics/Minix Minix] ''Comp Wisdon''</ref>

=== Emulating other systems ===
{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}
The Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], Commodore 64, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]], up to platforms such as the IBM PC, Apple Macintosh and Atari ST. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.

== Amiga software ==
{{Main|Amiga software}}
The Amiga was a primary target for productivity and game development during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Software was often developed for the Amiga and the [[Atari ST]] simultaneously, since the ST had a similar CPU architecture.

<!-- Technical trivialities, like how many bytes that is moved across the bus, is not all that interesting. And try to keep AmigaOS stuff to the AmigaOS article -->
[[Aminet]] was created in 1992 and until around 1996, was the largest public archive of software for any platform.

== Boing Ball ==
[[Image:boingball.png|thumb|The Boing Ball.]]
The Boing Ball has been synonymous with Amiga since its public release in 1985. The bouncing ball (or other graphical elements) has been a popular theme in computer [[demo effect]]s since the 1950s, when a bouncing ball demo was released for [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computers and became the primary theme for early Atari games [[Pong]] and [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. [[Commodore International|Commodore]] released a bouncing ball demo at the 1978 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], to illustrate the capabilities of the VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time [[animation]] showing a red-and-white spinning ball (about 1/4 screen size) bouncing up and down and casting a shadow on a wall behind it. The echoing deep Bong! sound and left-right motion was added soon after the show was over. Since then, the Boing Ball became one of the most well-known symbols for Amiga and compatible computers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Within the context of this tradition of bouncing ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a Bouncing Ball demo for the [[Atari]] VCS/2600, with a spinning and bouncing ball, at the same event.

The 1984 Boing Ball demo was one of the very first demos shown on the Amiga. It was specifically designed to take advantage of the Amiga's custom graphics, achieving a level of speed and smoothness not previously seen on an affordable computer. The 1984 demo ran standalone as there was no official DOS operating system and Intuition was just a glint in [[Robert J. Mical|RJ Mical]]'s eye at the time. A year later this demo was converted to operate in an [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] Screen, allowing the higher resolution Amiga Workbench screen to be dragged down to make the Boing Ball visible from behind, bouncing up above the Workbench while the Workbench remained fully active. Since the Boing Ball used almost no CPU time (only to calculate the bounce angles - animation was handled by playfield vertical and horizontal scrolling tricks, the rotation animation was done with [[color cycling]] in the graphics chip, and of course the sound chip handled the sound), this made a particularly impressive demonstration of multitasking at the time.

The Boing Ball itself was never officially adopted as a [[trademark]] by [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. The official Amiga trademark was a rainbow-colored double [[checkmark]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/originsboing.html|title=Dr. Ryan Czerwinski of Merlancia Industries explains the origin of the Amiga Boing ball and checkmark|author=Ryan Czerwinski|date=December 31, 2001|work=Amiga Network News| accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref>

== Amiga community ==
When Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there was still a very active Amiga community, and it continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. 

Despite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine [[Micro Mart]]. There is also a web site, [http://www.amiga.org/index.php Amiga.org], that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy.

<title>AmigaBASIC</title>
<text>[[Image:AmigaBASIC.png|right|thumb|300px|AmigaBASIC running the "Demo" program]]
'''AmigaBASIC''' was an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] [[BASIC]] [[programming language]] implementation for the [[Amiga]], designed and written by [[Microsoft]].  AmigaBASIC shipped with [[AmigaOS]] versions 1.1 to 1.3. It succeeded Metacomco's [[ABasiC]], which was included in AmigaOS 1.0 and 1.1, and it was replaced with [[ARexx]], a [[REXX]]-style scripting language, from AmigaOS version 2.0 onwards.

==History and description==

AmigaBASIC provided not only the common BASIC language, but also attempted to provide an easy-to-use [[API]] for the Amiga's unique graphics and sound capabilities. OBJECT commands, for example, made it easy to create moving objects – [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and bobs that could be drawn with an external drawing program, ''Object editor'', that was supplied with AmigaBASIC. An unusual feature of the language is that it theoretically allowed the calling of handwritten [[assembly language]] subprograms; however, this feature never worked because of a bug that failed to align the assembly language instructions correctly on a [[word (computing)|word]] boundary, as required by the Amiga's native [[MC68000]] processor.

''[[Compute!]]'', a popular computer magazine published while AmigaBASIC was still being shipped, included many AmigaBASIC programs in their articles.  ''Compute!'' readers could type the source code into the AmigaBASIC editor to add new software to their Amiga.  The source code listings were typically implementations of simple programs, such as rudimentary games, analog clocks and address books.

Many of today's successful computer programmers got their start on AmigaBASIC, including a few that work at Valve Software, the company that makes the Half-Life series of games. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

AmigaBASIC itself was rendered obsolete by being incompatible with AmigaOS 2.0 and also hardware based on successors to the [[Motorola 68000]] CPU due to its neglect of some programming guidelines set forth by Commodore. However, there were a number of third-party compiled BASIC languages released for the Amiga that could compile AmigaBASIC programs with minimal changes, like A/C BASIC or Cursor (see below). Some of these compiled BASICs continued to work with AmigaOS 2.0, and as they were compiled rather than interpreted, generally ran much faster than the original.

Although AmigaBASIC was superseded by ARexx in AmigaOS 2.0, the two languages had very different functions and capabilities. Hobbyist programmers had changed by the time of this release and were more likely to be interested in incorporating existing third party applications into their programs than in writing new programs entirely from scratch. ARexx was seen as better fitting their needs than the older BASIC interpreter.

==Hello World in AmigaBASIC==

<pre>
' Hello World for AmigaBASIC
PRINT "Hello world!"
</pre>
You can go one better by adding the following line:
<pre>
SAY TRANSLATE$ ("HELLO WORLD")
</pre>
The Amiga will then say "Hello world" using [[speech synthesis]] in addition to displaying it on screen.

==Other BASIC languages for AmigaOS==
* [[Metacomco]] [[ABasiC]] was a non-Microsoft Basic that was shipped with Amiga 1000 systems with Workbench 1.0, before AmigaBasic was available.  ABasiC provided a more traditional Basic programming environment, requiring numbered lines and lacking support for [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] windowing.  ABasiC did provide very good support for Amiga graphics and sound features otherwise, however.
* [[ACE BASIC Compiler|ACE]] was an AmigaBASIC compiler, written by David Benn. The compiler produced [[Motorola 68000]] [[assembly language]] which could be assembled and linked into native Amiga executables.  The primary benefits were performance, lower run-time memory requirements, the ability to execute software without AmigaBASIC, and the ability to distribute software without having to release the actual source code.  ACE also provided additional language constructs to expand upon the capability of the AmigaBASIC language.
* A/C Basic by Absoft was a compiler for AmigaBASIC programs that turned them into native executables that could be run without AmigaBASIC or the program's source code being present.
* '''Cursor''' was another AmigaBASIC editor and compiler.
* [[GFA BASIC]], originally developed for the [[Atari ST]], was ported to the Amiga platform by its author, [[Frank Ostrowski]].
* [[HiSoft BASIC]] was another BASIC variant ported from the Atari ST to the Amiga.
* [[AMOS (programming language)|AMOS BASIC]], developed by [[François Lionet]], was a commercial language which provided extensive support for the Amiga's graphics hardware and was designed primarily for games programming. It was used to write several commercial games and educational software.
* [[Blitz BASIC]] was a direct commercial competitor to AMOS, published by [[Acid Software]]. Like AMOS, it was targeted at games programming. Its successor, Blitz Basic 2, was used to write several commercial games, including the popular [[Team17]] game [[Worms (computer game)|Worms]].

==Description==
{{See also|AmigaOS}}

AmigaOS 4 can be divided into two parts; the [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] and the [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]].

===Workbench===
The [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] is the GUI of OS4, a graphical interface file manager and application launcher for the Operating System. It also includes some general purpose tools and utility programs such as a Notepad for typing text, MultiView for viewing images and [[Amigaguide]] documents, Unarc for unpacking Archives, a PDF reader, a number of small preferences programs for changing settings of the GUI and OS etc., etc.

===Kickstart===
The [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] contains many of the core components of the OS. Prior to version 4 of AmigaOS the Kickstart had been released mostly on a [[Read-only memory|ROM]] (included with the computer). In OS4 the Kickstart is instead stored on the hard disk. It consists mainly of:

* [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]], a preemptive multitasking kernel.
* [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]], a windowing system API.
* [[AmigaDOS]] and AmigaShell, the AmigaDOS is the disk operating system for the OS, whereas the Shell is the integrated Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI and the GUI complement each other and share the same privileges.
* [[Petunia JIT|Petunia]], a Motorola 68020 processor emulator with dynamic recompilation, also called just-in-time compilation ([[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilation), for PowerPC based Amigas. It gives OS4 backward compatibility to some extent, it will only run system friendly (following the OS3.x API without communicating directly with the classic Amigas' [[Amiga#Hardware|custom chipset]]) AmigaOS 3.x programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiga.hu/amigos/rachy/petunia.html

|accessdate=2010-11-10}}</ref> For the programs that Petunia can't handle, such as most "bang the hardware" (which uses legacy Amiga hardware directly) Amiga [[Amiga games|games]] and [[Amiga demos|demos]], the third party OS4 native emulator [[E-UAE]] can be used which can emulate different Amiga chipsets (OCS, ECS, AGA) as well.

==History==
{{Main|History of the AmigaOS 4 dispute}}

During the five years of development, users of [[AmigaOne]] machines could download Pre-Release versions of AmigaOS 4.0 from Hyperion's repository as long as these were made available. As witnessed by many users on Amiga discussion forum sites, these versions were stable and reliable, despite the fact that they were technically labeled as "Pre-Releases".

On 20 December 2006, [[Amiga, Inc]] abruptly terminated<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiga.com/about/history/?t=os |title=Announcement at Amiga Inc. official site |publisher=Amiga.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080729061610/http://www.amiga.com/about/history/?t=os| archivedate = July 29, 2008}}</ref> the contract with [[Hyperion Entertainment]] to produce or sell AmigaOS 4. Nevertheless, AmigaOS 4.0 was released commercially for Amigas with [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] accelerator cards in November 2007<ref>[http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz:8080/news/2007-11-22 AmigaOS 4.0 for Classic Amiga gone Gold.]</ref> (having been available only to developers and beta-testers until then). The Italian computer company [[ACube Systems]] has announced [[Sam440ep]]<ref>[http://www.acube-systems.biz/eng/sam.php SAM440ep motherboard.]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> and Sam440ep-flex motherboards, which are AmigaOS 4 compatible. Also, a third party bootloader, known as the "Moana", was released on torrent sites; it allows installation of the Sam440ep version of OS4 to Mac Mini G4's. However this is both unofficial and unsupported as of today, and very incomplete, especially regarding drivers. During the judicial procedure (between Hyperion and Amiga, Inc),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/washington/wawdce/2:2007cv00631/143245/ |title=Amiga Inc v.

On 30 September 2009, Hyperion Entertainment and Amiga, Inc reached settlement agreement where Hyperion is granted an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market AmigaOS 4.x and subsequent versions of AmigaOS (including AmigaOS 5 without limitation).<ref>{{Cite web

===Development process===
{{Main|AmigaOS versions}}

There have been many different versions of the [[AmigaOS]] operating system (OS) during its two decades of history.

====Versions 1.0 to 1.4====
[[Image:Amiga Workbench 1 0.png|thumb|200px|Amiga Workbench 1.0 (1985).]]

The first AmigaOS was introduced in 1985 and developed by [[Commodore International]]. It was nicknamed [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|''Workbench'']] from the name of its [[Graphical user interface]] (GUI), due to an error of Commodore Marketing and Sales Department, which labeled the OS disk just with the name "Workbench Disk" and not with the correct name "AmigaOS Disk (Workbench)". The first versions of AmigaOS (1.0 and up to 1.3) are here indicated with the name of their original disks to preserve original custom.

Kickstart/Workbench 1.4 was a [[Software testing#Beta testing|beta]] version of the upcoming 2.0 update and never released, but the Kickstart part was shipped in very small quantities with early [[Amiga 3000]] computers, where it is often referred to as the "[[Superkickstart]] ROM". In these machines it is only used to bootstrap the machine and load the Kickstart that will be used to actually boot the system. The appearance of a very early first release of 1.4 was similar to 1.3, but with colors slightly changed. A second version was similar to that of 2.0 and higher, with just minor differences. It is, however, possible to dump out of the OS selection screen by clicking where one would expect to see a close gadget. This will cause the machine to boot Kickstart 1.4 using either the wb_2.x: partition, or from a floppy.

[[File:Wb 20.png|thumb|200px|Amiga Workbench 2.0 (1990).]]

====Versions 2.0 to 3.1====
Workbench 2.0 improvements introduced a lot of major advances to the GUI of Amiga operating system. The blue and orange colour scheme was replaced with a grey and light blue with 3D aspect in the border of the windows. The Workbench was no longer tied to the 640×256 (PAL) or 640×200 (NTSC) display modes, and much of the system was improved with an eye to making future expansion easier. For the first time, a standardised "look and feel" was added. This was done by creating the ''Amiga Style Guide'', and including libraries and software which assisted developers in making conformant software. Technologies included the GUI element creation library ''gadtools'', the software installation scripting language ''Installer'', and the ''[[AmigaGuide]]'' hypertext help system.

====Versions 3.5 and 3.9====
<!--[[Image:AmigaOS.svg|right|thumb|200px|Evolution of AmigaOS.]]-->
[[File:AmigaOS 3 and clones.svg|right|thumb|200px|Evolution of AmigaOS 3.x.]]
After the demise of [[Commodore International|Commodore]], the later owners of the Amiga trademark granted a license to a German company called [[Haage &amp;Partner]] to update the Amiga's operating system. Along with this update came a change in the way people referred to the Amiga's operating system. Rather than specifying "Kickstart" or "Workbench", the updates were most often referred to as simply "AmigaOS".
Whereas all previous OS releases were Motorola 68000 compatible, some OS components from release 3.5 onwards required a 68020 or better.

====Versions 4.0 and 4.1====
Eventually Amiga Inc. contracted Hyperion Entertainment to develop the [[PowerPC]] native AmigaOS 4 (OS4).
<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BxlY9g_OfLqDMDUxZWU2MDQtYWNmMi00ZmQyLTlmMDctYTdhYzdmYTM2YWQ1&amp;hl=en |title=Amiga/Hyperion contract|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> Unlike the previous versions which were based on the [[Motorola]] [[68k]] central processor, OS4 is running only on PowerPC computer systems. Amiga, Inc.'s (current Amiga trademark owners) distribution policies for AmigaOS 4.0 and any later versions required that OS4 must be bundled with all new third-party hardware "Amigas", with the sole exception of Amigas with [[Phase5]] PowerPC accelerator boards, for which OS4 is sold separately. This requirement was overturned in the agreement reached between Amiga, Inc. and Hyperion in the settlement of a lawsuit over the ownership of AmigaOS 4.

==AmigaOS 4 prominent features==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2010|discuss=Talk:AmigaOS_4#Fast ON and OFF}}
{{Unreliable sources|section|date=November 2010}}
Prominent features compared to other operating systems or previous versions of AmigaOS:<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 23, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx3q2wFIn6k |title=YouTube video "Why use Amiga in 2009? - Long cut" |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>

===General===
* '''Quick on:''' AmigaOS boots and reboots up in a few seconds.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87DeoBqGSeA |title=YouTube video AmigaOS 4.1 Startup and reboot |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>
* '''Instant off / fast reboot:''' An oft-touted feature is that AmigaOS can be switched off in an instant by just hitting the off switch.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ofkdlGGF4 |title=YouTube video AmigaOS 4.1 Reboot and shut down |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>  Arguably, however, this is not a feature, but a low expectation.  AmigaOS is as vulnerable to dataloss as any other operating system, should it be switched off at the wrong time.  In fact, operating systems with modern filesystem data integrity checking are actually more capable of surviving this.
* '''Responsiveness:''' Optimized to '''respond to user actions''' in an instant. A fully pre-emptive multitasking scheduler ensures that important tasks will get a fair share of processing time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Appearance===
[[File:AmiagOS 4 screen drag.png|right|thumb|Workbench screen in front, web browser screen behind.]]
* '''Screens:''' You can have as many different screens as you like for any purpose, each with its own application on it. Or you can open a "public screen" which several applications can share. Switching between different screens takes an instant, and you can come back to an application and find it exactly how you left it. It is even possible to drag the current screen down to reveal another screen behind it (even with a different screen resolution), so that you can view two screens simultaneously, or even drag and drop files and other content from one screen to another.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 19, 2007 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSA-q1qniMY |title=YouTube video Amiga OS4 Intuition |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>
* '''Customisable [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]:''' Allows replacement of window gadgets with new designs, application of [[gradient]]s or [[texture (computer graphics)|textures]] of your choice to virtually every graphical element in the interface. It is possible to alter the geometry of the window drawing to suit personal taste, change font usage throughout the interface, configure the appearance of menus and chose own 3D effects. Having a different look for each public screen is also feasible.
* '''Menuing:''' The menu bar appears at the top of the screen when pressed down the right mouse button, and disappears when it is not needed, thus reducing screen clutter and giving more room to work.

===File handling===
* '''Clear file structure:''' Operating system files are divided up into clearly labelled drawers (folders) so you know exactly where to find whatever you're looking for. For example, all libraries are stored in "Libs:" standard virtual device and absolute path finder for "Libs" directory, Fonts are all in "Fonts:" absolute locator, the files for language localization are all stored in "Locale:" and so on.
* '''[[RAM disk]]:''' Like a virtual hard drive, it acts like any other disk, and stores files and data in memory rather than on your actual hard drive. The RAM disk is dynamically resizable and takes up only as much of your memory as it needs to. It can be used as a temporary store for your own purposes or as a place for software installers to put temporary files, and is cleared out at reboot so you won't be cluttering up your computer with thousands of unnecessary files that bog down your system. Additionally there is an optional '''RAD disk''', a recoverable version of the RAM disk, which preserves contents after a reboot.<ref>[http://www.amigaos4.com/index.php%3Foption=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=.html Feature Spotlight: The RAM Disk.]</ref>
* '''Datatypes:''' Recognises and '''handles file types''': displaying a picture, playing a music file, decoding a video file, rendering a web page etc. Any application can access Datatypes transparently, and thus have the ability to use any file that you have a Datatype for.
* '''Icon handling:''' A file can have a default icon representing the type of file or a custom icon specific to the individual file. Additionally icons can store extra commands and [[metadata]] about the associated file — which program to open it in, for example.
* '''Assigning devices:''' Instead of assigning drives (devices) a letter or fixed label, each drive can be given a name. Drives can be given more than one name so the system always knows where things are, if it is the system boot drive it is also known as "Sys:". Areas of hard drive can be assigned a label as if they were a virtual disk. For example, it is possible to mount MP3 players as "MP3:" and external networked resources as logical devices.

===Other===
[[File:AmigaOS 4.1 Update 1 Live CD.png|thumb|right|Booted from AmigaOS 4.1 Update 1 Live CD.]]
* '''Live CD:''' The OS4 installation CD can be used as a [[Live CD]].
* '''Dockies:''' It is a fully configurable docking bar for icons, allowing quick access to most used applications. These dock bar icons, "Dockies", are fully dynamic, which means they can show real-time content and act as useful micro tools. A Docky might act as a magnifying glass, display the time, or show you the latest weather forecast or stock market information direct from the Internet.
* '''Scripting:''' Implemented scripting as a fundamental feature. Using the [[AREXX]] scripting language and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] it is possible to automate, integrate and remote control almost every application and function of the computer. Function sets and tools from several applications can be brought together into a single, integrated interface to allow the most complex jobs to be performed with the utmost simplicity.
[[File:Amiga-grim1.png|thumb|right|A visit from the Grim Reaper.]]
* '''[[Guru Meditation|The Grim Reaper]]:''' The "[[Guru Meditation]]" is replaced by "The Grim Reaper", a crash handling system that catches crashes and lock ups, and stops them from getting out of control. It can provide complete information about the crash and can simply kill the offending task and free up the resources it was using.
* '''AmiUpdate:'''  Is an updating system designed purely for the latest incarnation of the AmigaOS 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiupdate.net/ |title=AmigaOS 4 updating system |publisher=Amiupdate.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> It is capable to update OS files and also all Amiga programs which are registered to use the same update program that is standard for Amiga. Updating AmigaOS requires only few libraries to be put in standard OS location "Libs:", "Fonts:" etc. This leaves Amiga users with a minimal knowledge of the system almost free to perform by hand the update of the system files.

[[Image:AmigaOne Micro-A1.png|thumb|Teron Mini ("AmigaOne Micro-A1") motherboard.]]

''AmigaOne''' is a series of [[computer platform]], intended to run [[AmigaOS]] [[AmigaOS 4.0|version 4.0]] created by [[Hyperion Entertainment]]. Earlier models were produced by [[Eyetech]], and were based on the [[Teron]] series of [[PowerPC]] POP [[Motherboard|mainboards]]. In January 2010, [[A-Eon Technology]] announced a new computer, the [[AmigaOne X1000]], which they have claimed will feature a dual core PowerPC motherboard, and is also intended to run AmigaOS 4.x.  It has been announced that the forthcoming AmigaOne X1000 will be distributed by AmigaKit.

==History==
Originally, AmigaOne was the name of a project for new [[Amiga]] hardware, managed by [[Eyetech]] and designed by the German company Escena GmbH. The AmigaOne motherboard was to be available in two models, the AmigaOne-1200 and the AmigaOne-4000. It was to have connectors for an optionally attached [[Amiga 1200]] or an [[Amiga 4000]] respectively, in order to use the old custom chips of an Amiga. This AmigaOne project was cancelled in 2001, mostly due to the inability to find or design a suitable [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chip.

After the Escena design was abandoned, Eyetech sought an alternative solution. The result was that in 2002 they decided to use the [[Teron CX]] PowerPC evaluation motherboard for a product named "AmigaOnepointfive" which eventually became the AmigaOne SE. Later, the [[Teron PX]] motherboard was marketed by Eyetech as the Amiga One XE, followed by the Teron Mini which was marketed as Micro-A1 (also known as µ-A1). The Teron is based on [[IBM]]'s PowerPC Open Platform specification, and uses the U-Boot firmware.

The main difference between the [[ATX]]-format AmigaOne SE and XE was that the AmigaOne SE had a soldered-on 600 MHz [[PowerPC G3#PowerPC 750CXe|PowerPC 750CXe]] processor, whereas the AmigaOne XE used a CPU board attached to a MegArray connector on the motherboard. While the MegArray connector is physically similar to the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Power Mac G4]] CPU daughtercard connector, it is not electrically compatible. There were [[PowerPC G3|G3]] and [[PowerPC G4|G4]] options with a maximum clock frequency of 800 MHz and 933 MHz. The G4 module originally used a Freescale [[PowerPC G4#PowerPC_7450_.22Voyager.22.2F.22V.27ger.22|7451]] processor which was later changed to a Freescale [[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7445.2F7455 .22Apollo 6.22|7455]], both without level 3 cache. The G4 CPU runs hotter and requires a better heatsink than that supplied on some machines. Consequently, the G4 was often supplied underclocked to run at 800 MHz. In 2007 Acube offered 1.267 GHz 7457(See below). The last Teron motherboard used by Eyetech was the Teron Mini series of motherboards, which were somewhat similar to the Teron PX but made in a [[Mini-ITX]] formfactor and with some additions, such as onboard graphics, and a better [[PowerPC G3#PowerPC 750GX|750GX]] CPU. The Micro-A1 was announced in two configurations, under the Micro-A1 I (Industrial) and Micro-A1 C (Consumer) labels. Only the C configuration was produced.

Both AmigaOneG3-XE and AmigaOneG4-XE have four 32-bit PCI-slots (3x 33 MHz, 1x 66 MHz) and one AGP-2x slot. The Micro-A1 has only one 32-bit PCI-slot and an integerated Radeon 7000 via AGP with dedicated 32 MB VRAM.

When the AmigaOne boards first became available, OS4 was not ready: they were supplied with various Linux distributions. From April 2004 onwards, boards were shipped with a "developer prerelease" version of OS4.

The full version of OS4 was launched in early 2007 for AmigaOne computers only, with the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] version being released in December 2007. [[AmigaOS 4.1]] for AmigaOne has been released on September 2008.

==Operating systems==
*Linux for PowerPC
*[[AmigaOS 4]] versions 4.0, 4.1.

==Current status==
MAI Logic Inc. went bankrupt, and consequently the supply of a major part for the Eyetech AmigaOnes dried up. Eyetech Group Ltd stopped the sales of the MicroA1 due to the naturally ensuing lack of bridge chips.

In January 2010, a new company, A-Eon, announced a new AmigaOne model, the [[AmigaOne X1000]].

==AmigaOne clones and compatibles==
The [[Sam440]] mainboard (complete with PPC CPU) is an embedded motherboard launched by [[Acube Systems]] in September 2007. [[AmigaOS 4]] was released for the Sam440 in October 2008.

In January 2009, [[AmigaOS 4]] was released for the [[Pegasos]] 2 (G3 and G4) computer platform.

===Prestel, Videotel, Videotex, Minitel===
In some European countries, and especially in France, [[Minitel]] data transmitting services were very popular before the rise of Internet. Minitel started the phenomenon of chatting, exchange mail, providing on-line services such as railways or TV broadcast timetables, travel and hotel booking, etcetera. Minitel used little terminals rented from telephone companies or computers with modems that accept Minitel transmission protocol speed. The speed was asynchronous at 1200/75 baud (1200 baud receiving, 75 baud transmitting). There were made Amiga Minitel communication programs in France, Germany and Italy. In Italy it was released [[Amiga Videotel]].

===Teletext, Televideo, Viewdata===
Teletext is an information retrieval service system based on transmitting data with normal TV broadcast signals and showing it separately, without interfering with normal TV programs. About this kind of service, on Amiga there are TV cards viewers that view Teletext pages and save them as standard image files. Standalone programs for Teletext included the [[Amiga Teletext]] program, and the datatype [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/download.php?file=vtx_dt Videotex Datatype].

==Communication Protocols==
[[Skypix]] is the name of a communication protocol born on Amiga. It could be considered one of the very first (or even the real first) modern interactive online graphics-and-sound protocol.<ref name="Skyline">{{Cite web| title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher=Jason Scott for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine | author=Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}}</ref>, as it was introduced in 1987 as part of the Skyline (Atredes) BBS System, running on the program Skyline BBS and Skyterm terminal for the Amiga system. Years before the World Wide Web, Skypix allowed rich interactive graphics and sound, as well as mouse control, to be a part of the online experience, which was until then limited to text and ANSI graphics. Skypix allowed users the ability to write graphical programs and link them into the system, as well as the first "authoring program", Skypaint. Skypix created a large worldwide group of enthusiastic game and online application writers years before the World Wide Web made such features a common part of the online experience. It was quickly abandoned as long as new, more advanced, markup languages for BBS were available and due to the emerging of Internet phenomenon that literally wiped out the BBS system of communication.

}}</ref>
Prior to founding the [[Knoesis]] center, he served as the director of the Large Scale Distributed [[Information Systems]] lab, at the [[University of Georgia]] in [[Athens, Georgia]].

==Education==

Sheth received his Bachelors in Engineering from the prestigious [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science]] in Computer Science in the year 1981.
He received his MS and Ph.D in Computer Science from the [[Ohio State University]] in 1983 and 1985 respectively.

==Research==
===Semantic Interoperability/Integration and Semantic Web===
Sheth has investigated, demonstrated, and advocated comprehensive use of [[metadata]]. He explored syntactical, structural, and semantic metadata; recently, he has pioneered ontology-driven approaches to metadata extraction and semantic analytics. He was among the first researchers to utilize [[description logics]] based ontologies for schema and information integration (a decade before W3C adopted a DL-based ontology representation standard). His work on multi-ontology query processing includes the most cited paper on the topic (over 485 citations). In 1996, he introduced the powerful concept of Metadata Reference Link (MREF) for associating metadata to hypertext that links documents on the Web, and described an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]-based realization in 1998, long before RDF was adopted as a W3C recommendation. A part of his recent work has focussed on information extraction from text to generate semantic metadata in the form of RDF. In his work, semantic metadata extracted from biological text is made up of complex knowledge structures (complex entities and relationships) that reflect complex interactions in biomedical knowledge<ref name="ramakrishnan">

|accessdate= 2008-05-31
}}</ref> based on the semantic metadata extracted from text.  He has written many articles regarding this.

===Workflow Management and Semantic Web Services===
In the early 1990s, he initiated research in the formal modeling, scheduling, and correctness of workflows. His METEOR project demonstrated the value of research with real-world applications; its tools were used in graduate courses in several countries, and its technology was licensed to create a commercial product.

The follow-on METEOR-S project has been highly influential. He led the research (later joined by [[IBM]]) that resulted in the [[W3C]] submission of WSDL-S (Semantic Annotation of [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]), the basis for [[SAWSDL]], a [[W3C recommendation]] for adding semantics to [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]].

He currently guides the development of SA-REST, which supports [[microformat]]-based annotation of popular [[RESTful]] services and WebAPIs. For both SAWSDL and SA-REST, he has provided leadership in the community-based process followed by [[W3C]]. He coauthored a 1995 paper in the journal of Distributed &amp;Parallel Databases (Springer),which is one of the most cited papers in the area of workflow management literature, with more than 1200 citations, as well as the most cited among over 430 papers published in that journal.<ref name="googleScholar">

<title>Amplitude amplification</title>
<text>'''Amplitude amplification''' is a technique in [[quantum computing]] which generalizes the idea behind
the [[Grover's algorithm|Grover's search algorithm]], and gives rise to a family of
[[quantum algorithm]]s.
It was discovered by [[Gilles Brassard]] and
[[Peter Høyer]] in 1997,

and independently rediscovered by [[Lov K. Grover|Lov Grover]] in 1998.

In a quantum computer, amplitude amplification can be used to obtain a
quadratic speedup over several classical algorithms.

</ref>.
Assume we have an N-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] <math>\mathcal{H}</math>
representing the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|state space]] of our quantum system, spanned by the
orthonormal computational basis states <math>\mathbf{B} := \{ |x\rangle \}_{x=0}^{N-1}</math>.
Furthermore assume we have a Boolean [[Oracle_machine#Definition|oracle]] function
:<math>\chi:\mathbb{Z} \to \{0,1\}</math>.
<math>\chi</math> can be used to partition
<math>\mathcal{H}</math> into a direct sum of two mutually orthogonal subspaces,
the ''good'' subspace <math>\mathcal{H}_1 = \operatorname{span}\{|x\rangle \in \mathbf{B} \;|\; \chi(x) = 1\}</math>, and
the ''bad'' subspace <math>\mathcal{H}_0 = \operatorname{span}\{|x\rangle \in \mathbf{B} \;|\; \chi(x) = 0\}</math>.

Given a (normalized) state vector <math>|\psi\rangle \in \mathcal{H}</math> which has nonzero overlap with both subspaces, we can
uniquely decompose it as 
:<math>|\psi\rangle = a |\psi_1\rangle  + b |\psi_0\rangle</math>,
where
<math>|\psi_1\rangle</math> and <math>|\psi_0\rangle</math> are the
normalized projections of  <math>|\psi\rangle</math> into the
subspaces <math>\mathcal{H}_1</math> and <math>\mathcal{H}_0</math>,
respectively, and <math>0 &amp;lt; a &amp;lt; 1</math>.
This decomposition defines a two-dimensional subspace
<math>\mathcal{H}_\psi</math>, spanned by the vectors
<math>|\psi_0\rangle</math> and <math>|\psi_1\rangle</math>.
<!-- (The degenerate case, where<math>|\psi\rangle</math> lies entirely in one of the subspaces ...) -->
The probability of finding the system in a ''good'' state when measured
is <math>a^2</math>. Furthermore we have <math>a^2+b^2=1</math>.

Define a unitary operator
<math>Q(\psi, \chi) := -S_\psi S_\chi \,\!</math>,
where
:<math>
\begin{align}
S_\psi &amp;= I - 2|\psi\rangle \langle\psi|\quad \text{and}\\
S_\chi |x\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{\chi(x)} |x\rangle.
\end{align}
</math>
The action of this operator on <math>\mathcal{H}_\psi</math> is given by
:<math>Q |\psi_0\rangle = -S_\psi |\psi_0\rangle = (1-2a^2)|\psi_0\rangle +2ab|\psi_1\rangle</math> and
:<math>Q |\psi_1\rangle = S_\psi |\psi_1\rangle = -2ab|\psi_0\rangle
+(1-2a^2)|\psi_1\rangle</math>.
By defining <math>\theta := \arcsin(a) \,\!</math>,
<math>0 &amp;lt; \theta &amp;lt; \pi/2 \,\!</math>, we can clearly see that in this subspace <math>Q</math>
corresponds to a rotation by the angle <math>2\theta\,\!</math>:
:<math>Q = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos(2\theta) &amp;\sin(2\theta)\\
-\sin(2\theta) &amp;\cos(2\theta)
\end{pmatrix}</math>.

<!-- Outside <math>\mathcal{H}_\psi</math> the operator <math>Q</math> acts simply as <math>-S_\chi</math>...-->

Applying <math>Q(\psi, \chi)\,\!</math> repeatedly on the state
<math>|\psi\rangle</math>
gives
:<math>Q^n |\psi\rangle = \cos((2n+1) \theta) |\psi_0\rangle +\sin((2n+1)\theta) |\psi_1\rangle</math>,
rotating the state between the ''good'' and ''bad'' subspaces.
After <math>n</math> iterations the probability of finding the
system in a ''good'' state is <math>\sin^2((2n+1)\theta)\,\!</math>.<br/>
The probability is maximized if we choose
:<math>n = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4\theta}\right\rfloor</math>.
Up until this point each iteration increases the amplitude of the ''good'' states, hence
the name of the technique.

== Applications ==

Assume we have an unsorted database with N elements, and an oracle function
<math>\chi</math> which can recognize the ''good'' entries we are searching for.

If there are G such entries in the database in total, then we can find them by
initializing the quantum computer into a uniform superposition
:<math>|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |k\rangle</math>
of all the database elements,
and running the above algorithm. In this case the overlap of the initial state with the ''good'' subspace is equal to the
frequency of the ''good'' entries in the database, <math>a^2 = G/N</math>.
If <math>a \ll 1</math>, we can approximate the number of required iterations as
:<math>n = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4\theta}\right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4 \arcsin(a)}\right\rfloor
\approx \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4 a}\right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{N}{G}}\right\rfloor = O(\sqrt{N}).
</math>
Measuring the state will now give one of the ''good'' entries with a high probability. Since each iteration requires a single oracle query,
we can find a ''good'' entry with just <math>O(\sqrt{N})</math> oracle queries, thus obtaining a quadratic speedup over the best possible classical algorithm.

If we set G to one, the above scenario essentially reduces to the original Grover search.

She began her work in the industry on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], making her design debut with ''[[Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City]]''. She soon went to work for [[Crystal Dynamics]], working primarily on the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' series. With Naughty Dog, her work has been on two primary series: the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series and the ''[[Uncharted]]'' series.

With her writing style, Hennig believes that the creative direction of a script holds more importance than the graphics of the game. She has been called one of the most influential women in the [[video game industry]] by ''[[Edge magazine]]'', and has been cited as an example of how more women are becoming involved in a previously male dominated field.

==Life==
Three events in Hennig's life greatly influenced her later work; all happened in 1977. The release of the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', and ''[[Dungeons &amp;Dragons]]'' changed how games and entertainment in general would be developed.<ref name="LATimes"/>

Hennig graduated from [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[English literature]].<ref name="LATimes"/> She went on to the film school at [[San Francisco State University]], when she was hired as an artist for an [[Atari]] game called [[ElectroCop]].<ref name="LATimes"/> Her work on the game made her realize that the video game industry interested her more than the [[film industry]]; she dropped out of film school soon after.<ref name="LATimes"/> Hennig claims that her literature degree and film studies have helped her work: "Everything I learned as an undergraduate with English literature and in film school about editing and shots and the language of film has come into play, but in a way I couldn't possibly have planned.<ref name="LATimes"/>

==Career==
Hennig has worked in the [[video game industry]] for more than 17 years.<ref name="GSW">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/08/20-week/|title=Game Mag Weaseling’: Mag Roundup 8/26/06|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|date=26 August 2006|publisher=GameSetWatch.

Two years after being hired at [[Electronic Arts]], Hennig worked as an artist on  ''[[Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City]]''.<ref name="GSW"/> However, when the lead designer quit, Hennig landed the job.<ref name="LATimes"/> In the late 1990s, she moved to [[Crystal Dynamics]],<ref name="G4"/> where she assisted [[Silicon Knights]] in the development of ''[[Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain]]''. Later, she acted as the [[video game director|director]], [[Video game producer|producer]], and writer for ''[[Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/legacyofkainsoulreaver/tech_info.html|title= Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver Tech Info|date=2010|publisher=[[GameSpot]].

With ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'', Hennig led the 150 person team who created the game, as well as acting as writer.<ref name="LATimes"/>

==Writing style==
Hennig believes the term [[platformer]] is outdated and misused with many modern games, preferring a different term like "traversal" for some.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2007/11/19/naughty-dog-we-need-a-new-word-for-platformer/|title=Naughty Dog: We Need A New Word For "Platformer"|last=John|first=Tracey|date=19 November 2007|publisher=MTV Multiplayer Blog. [[MTV]]|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> She also feels that focusing too much on graphics can inhibit a game, saying that once game writers focus on creative expression, video games will greatly improve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3160325|title=The Future of Games|last=Ashley|first=Robert|date=18 June 2007|publisher=[[1UP.com]].

<title>Analog Protection System</title>
<text>The '''Analog Protection System''' (APS), also known as '''Copyguard''', is a [[DVD]] copy prevention system originally developed by [[Macrovision]]. Video tapes copied from [[DVD]]s encoded with APS become garbled and unwatchable. The process works by adding pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the [[automatic gain control|AGC]] circuit of a recording device.  In digital devices changes to the analog [[video signal]] are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device.  In [[DVD player]]s trigger bits are created during [[DVD authoring]] to inform the APS that it should be applied to DVD players analog outputs or analog video outputs on a [[personal computer|PC]] while playing back a protected DVD-Video disc. In [[set top box]]es trigger bits are incorporated into [[Conditional Access Entitlement Control Message]]s (ECM) in the stream delivered to the STB. In VHS alterations to the analog video signal are added in a [[Macrovision]]-provided “processor box” used by duplicators.

APS can be also signaled digitally, in the [[CGMS-A]] bit field sent in the [[vertical blanking interval]].

<title>Analogical models</title>
<text>'''Analogical models''' are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the ‘target system’ by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called '''dynamical analogies'''.

== Explanation ==

[[Analogy|Analogizing]] is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system).  A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called "analog" or "analogue" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce ''[[a priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' [[knowledge]] of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p. 1-3).

{{cquote|dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical, mechanical, acoustical, magnetic and electronic systems}} (Olson 1958, p. 2). 

For example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use [[voltage]] to represent an arithmetic quantity; [[operational amplifier]]s might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of [[calibration]] these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a ''one-to-one correspondence in behaviour'' between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one. 
<!--This doesn't seem right. Is the "model" the "target system" or the "analogue/source system"? It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh!-->

== Creating an analogical model ==

Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the [[Phillips Hydraulic Computer]] used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of [[simulation]].

<!--EXAMPLES WE NEED EXAMPLES!! -->

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}
==Hydraulic analogy==
* In an [[hydraulic]] analogy, a [[water integrator]] might be used to perform the mathematical operation of [[Integral|integration]].

==Physiological analogies==
*[[Francis Crick]] used the study of the [[visual system]] as a proxy for the study of [[awareness]].

==Formal analogies==
<!--Needs to be filled-->
*"The same [[equation]]s have the same [[solution]]s." -- [[Richard Feynman]]
**For example, the inverse-square laws of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis, almost without regard to the physical details about [[mass]]es and [[charge (physics)|charges]].

*[[Recursion]] requires  a similarity within a situation; for example, [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] to count the [[The Sand Reckoner|number of grains of sand on a beach]] by using the concept of myriad myriads.

== Dynamical analogies ==
Arising from his pioneering work in the field of acoustical engineering research, in 1958 (pp. 27–29) Dr. [[Harry F. Olson]] published a book of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamical]] analogies that includes a table of equivalent elements in different systems such as electrical, acoustical, and mechanical systems. He claimed that the analogies presented would aid in solving various problems of dynamical systems and would help the analysis describing the performance of such systems.

==Electronic circuit analogies==
=== Hydraulic Analog ===

A fluid or [[Hydraulic analogy]] of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry in terms of plumbing, where water represents the mobile sea of charge within metals, where pressure difference is analogy for [[Voltage]], and where water's flow rate is an analogy for [[Electric current]].

=== Analogue computers ===

Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful. Electronic circuit instruments called [[analog computers]] were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the [[norden bombsight]] could also consist of  gears and pulleys in calculation.

Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp. 105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and [[Howard T. Odum]] (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere.

==Philosophical conundrum==
The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/models-science/#ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their life time.

<title>Analysis on fractals</title>
<text>'''Analysis on fractals''' or '''calculus on fractals''' is a generalization of [[Differentiable manifold|calculus on smooth manifolds]] to [[calculus]] on [[fractals]].

The theory describes dynamical phenomena which occur on objects modelled by fractals.
It studies questions such as "how does heat diffuse in a fractal?" and "How does a fractal vibrate?"

In the smooth case the operator that occurs most often in the equations modelling these questions is the [[Laplacian]], so the starting point for the theory of analysis on fractals is to define a Laplacian on fractals. This turns out not to be a full [[differential operator]] in the usual sense but has many of the desired properties. There are a number of approaches to defining the Laplacian: probabilistic, analytical or measure theoretic.

<title>Analytical Profile Index</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}}

The '''Analytical Profile Index''' or '''API''' is a [[Biological classification|classification]] of [[bacteria]] based on experiments, allowing fast [[Identification (biology)|identification]]. It was invented in the 1970s in the United States by Pierre Janin of Analytab Products, Inc. [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3936356.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3936356&amp;RS=PN/3936356] Presently, the API test system is manufactured by bioMeriux.[http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/servlet/srt/bio/clinical-diagnostics/dynPage?doc=CNL_PRD_CPL_G_PRD_CLN_11] The API range introduced a standardized, miniaturized version of existing techniques, which up until then were complicated to perform and difficult to read.

The API 20E/NE fast identification system combines some conventional tests and allows the identification of a limited number of [[Gram-negative]] [[Enterobacteriaceae]] or non-Enterobacteriaceae. The test systems are stored in 20 small reaction tubes, which include the substrates. An identification is only possible with [[microbiological culture]].
To guarantee a comparability of different samples, follow the introductions of the manufacturer.

Before starting a test, it must be sure, the culture is an Enterobacteriaceae or not. To test it, a quick oxidase test for [[cytochrome c oxidase]] is mandatory. Here, Non-Enterobacteriaceae are cytochrome c oxidase positive and Enterobacteriaceae are negative. Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal [[enzyme]] of the [[electron transport chain]], in which the [[oxidation]] of [[cytochrome c]] and [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of O<sub>2</sub> is organized. The enzyme is localized in the [[mitochondria]] of [[eukaryotes]] and in the [[plasma membrane]] of several bacteria.

HINT:
This system is developed for quick identification of clinically relevant bacteria. Because of it, only known bacteria can be identified.

<title>Analytical mechanics</title>
<text>{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Formulations}}
'''Analytical mechanics''' is a term used for a refined, highly mathematical form of [[classical mechanics]], constructed from the 18th century onwards as a formulation of the subject as founded by [[Isaac Newton]]. Often the term '''vectorial mechanics''' is applied to the form based on Newton's work, to contrast it with analytical mechanics. This distinction makes sense because analytical mechanics uses two ''scalar'' properties of motion, the kinetic and potential energies, instead of vector forces, to analyze the motion.<ref name="Lanczos">{{cite book |title=The variational principles of mechanics |author=Cornelius Lanczos |page=Introduction, pp. xxi–xxix |edition=4rth Edition |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location= New York |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=isbn=0486650677&amp;sig=NL35zjprkiKvcdCyu5qa9AWQBLY#PPR21,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref> 

The subject has two parts: [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Lagrangian formulation identifies the actual path followed by the motion as a selection of the path over which the [[time integral]] of [[kinetic energy]] is least, assuming the total energy to be fixed, and imposing no conditions on the time of transit. The Hamiltonian formulation is more general, allowing time-varying energy, identifying the path followed to be the one with least ''[[Principle of least action|action]]'' (the integral over the path of the difference between kinetic and potential energies), holding the departure and arrival times fixed.<ref name="Lanczos"/><ref name="note">The term ''action'' has various meanings. This definition is only one, and corresponds specifically to an integral of the system [[Lagrangian]].</ref> These approaches underlie the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

It began with [[d'Alembert's principle]]. By analogy with [[Fermat's principle]], which is the [[variational principle]] in [[geometric optics]], [[Maupertuis' principle]] was discovered in classical mechanics.

Using generalized [[coordinate]]s, we obtain [[Lagrange's equations]]. Using the [[Legendre transformation]], we obtain [[generalized momentum]] and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]. 

[[Hamilton's canonical equations]] provides [[integral equation|integral]], while [[Lagrange's equation]] provides [[differential equations]]. Finally we may derive the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]].

The study of the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations leads naturally to the study of [[symplectic manifold]]s and [[symplectic topology]].<ref name="Arnold">{{cite book |title=Mathematical methods of classical mechanics |author=VI Arnolʹd |year=1989 |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd Edition |page= Chapter 8 |isbn=978-0-387-96890-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=9780387968902#PPT18,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref><ref name="Doran">{{cite book |title=Geometric algebra for physicists |author=C Doran &amp;A Lasenby |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=§12.3, pp. 432–439 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search}}</ref>  In this formulation, the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are the [[integral curve]]s of [[Hamiltonian vector field]]s.

<title>Analytical stereoplotter</title>
<text>[[Image:alpha2000.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Alpha 2000 analytical stereoplotter.]]


With the introduction of computers, the '''analytical stereoplotter''' became a popular machine of choice [[photogrammetry]] in the late 1960’s to 1970’s. A [[stereoplotter]] is an instrument that uses stereo photographs to determine elevations for the purpose of creating contours on [[Topographic map|topographic maps]]. Computers brought the capability to execute more precise calculations that ensure additional accurate output instead of approximations. This innovation also allowed a shift to a digital format rather than paper. Analytical stereoplotters edged out their analog predecessors and became the primary method of acquiring [[elevation]] data from [[Stereoscopy|stereo photographs]].

== Projection system ==

Analytical stereoplotters use a math projection based on the [[Collinearity equation|co-linearity]] (two vectors pointing in the same direction) equation model. The mechanical element of the device is a very accurate computer-controlled instrument that can view two photographs at the same time. The measurement system can be made to create a very precise and accurate measurement for images because the photo stages only move via the x and y [[Coordinates_(geographic)|coordinates]] that are programmed into the system. In comparison, to the analytical stereoplotter, the Kelsh stereoplotter was built with a fixed focal distance and [[focal length]] of lens for projection. The ratio for scale was also fixed. On the other hand, the analytical stereoplotter has no substantial limitations on focal length or [[Map scale|scale]].

== Viewing System ==

The analytical stereoplotters viewing system has an optical train system, which usually includes the ability to change the focal length of a camera by adjusting the lens. Style, size and color of the measuring mark can be adjusted in viewing system as well. There is also an illumination adjustment to each eye.

== Measuring and Tracing System ==

The analytical stereoplotter measuring system is made up of an input device for the operator to move the elevation point in three dimensions. The input device is programmed, and the digital measure of the elevation point deviation is sent to the computer. With this information, the program then is able to set and locate points for both the interior and exterior of the elevation and record measurements. The transfer of information is immediate and thus the person operating the machine is able to make any necessary adjustments to the coordinates. 

Elevations are measured in three steps, that include first measuring the interior orientation, then the relative orientation, and finally the absolute orientation. Interior orientation photographs are placed in relation to the center of the stereoplotter by aligning the fixed standard of reference points for measurement to corresponding points on the photograph. The focal length of the camera is also set. With relative orientation the angle of orientation of the camera relative to the place where the photos were the stereo-photo is taken programmed in the stereoplotter. This allows the effects of parallax (distortion of the final stereo-photo) to be reduced. In absolute orientation, the ground coordinates of a position are used to scale the model. You can use this to get the x, y, or z coordinates of any position on the stereo photographs. This information can be used for the construction of  [[Contour_line|contour lines]] for topographic maps.

==Synopsis==
===Magic bullets===
[[File:SSDI-SSI-1987-2003.png|thumb|left|alt=Chart showing increase (in red) over baseline (in blue) between 1987 and 2003|Number of Americans who received [[Social Security Disability Insurance|SSDI]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]] for mental disability in 1987 (blue) when [[Eli Lilly and Company]] introduced the antidepressive drug [[Prozac]], compared to 2003 (red).]]
Whitaker says that the drugs given to people with [[schizophrenia]] - [[antipsychotic]]s, and to people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] - [[antidepressant]]s, were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry, following that industry's development of "magic bullets" that treat people with, for example, [[diabetes]]. The public wanted to believe in "wonder drugs". Unfortunately, according to Whitaker the reasons the pharmaceutical companies gave for the drugs working (too much or too little [[dopamine]] or [[serotonin]] in the patient's brain) have not proved to be true.<ref>Whitaker, part two, chapters 3, 4 and 5</ref>

===Psychiatric drugs===
While Whitaker is pro-drug, he believes that medication must be used in a "selective, cautious manner. It should be understood that they’re not fixing any chemical imbalances. And honestly, they should be used on a short-term basis."<ref name="Lipinski">{{cite news|author=Lipinski, Jed|title="Anatomy of an Epidemic": The hidden damage of psychiatric drugs|date=April 27, 2010|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/27/interview_whitaker_anatomy_of_an_epidemic|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> He finds the idea that the "invention of [the antipsychotic] [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]]" emptied asylums to be a myth.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Anatomy of an Epidemic: Psychiatric Drugs and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America|url=http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic_Psychiatric_Drugs_Rise_of_Mental_Illness.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry|publisher=Springer|page=1|issue=I|volume=7|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> He traces the effects of what looks like an [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] epidemic<ref>Whitaker, p. 208</ref>—unfortunately, the drugs that patients receive can perturb their normal brain function.<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210">Whitaker, p. 210</ref>

{{cquote|"Psychiatrists saw that the drugs  'worked'. They saw that antipsychotics knocked down psychotic symptoms, and they observed that patients who stopped taking their medications regularly became psychotic again."<ref>Whitaker, p. 108</ref>}}

In contrast, Whitaker can only offer as a "solution" the style of care documented by professor Jaakko Seikkula at Keropudas Hospital in [[Tornio]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] where drugs are given to patients only on a limited basis—with good outcomes. According to Whitaker, the district has the lowest per capita spending on mental health of all health districts in [[Finland]].<ref>Whitaker, p. 343</ref>

===Children===
Whitaker sees that children are vulnerable to being prescribed a ''lifetime'' of drugs. As the author says, a psychiatrist and parents may give a child a "cocktail" to force him or her to behave. Then when this child grows up to eighteen, Whitaker says he or she becomes a disabled adult.<ref>Whitaker, chapters 11 and 12</ref>

==Review of data and statistics==
Over the year and a half he spent researching this book,<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210"/> Whitaker thoroughly reviewed U.S. government statistics and evidence in the scientific literature.<ref>[[Joseph Mercola]] says Whitaker has done his homework, and spent thousands (or tens of thousands) of hours on research in {{cite video|title=Dr. Mercola and Robert Whitaker Discuss Mental Health (part 3 of 7)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx2HiLyJ0-0|date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Joseph Mercola via YouTube|time=1:50|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> He maintains a website where the scientific studies are linked.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Mad in America|url=http://www.madinamerica.com/|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref>

As of October 2010, the only negative review of the book, written by sleep researcher Dennis Rosen for ''The Boston Globe'', asks for a review of data, and devotes a paragraph to [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[AIDS denialism]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rosen, Dennis|title=Tying the rise in mental illness to drugs used in its treatment|date=April 14, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/04/14/tying_the_rise_in_mental_illness_to_drugs_used_in_its_treatment/|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> Other reviews were in ''[[New Scientist]]'',<ref name="Burch"/> ''[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]'',<ref name="Good" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,<ref name="Fitzpatrick"/> and ''[[Salon.com|Salon]].<ref name="Lipinski" />

==Controversy==
Whitaker, who had been an invited keynote speaker, was "uninvited" from the Alternatives 2010 conference. The event has been funded since 1985 by the Substance Abuse &amp;Mental Health Services Administration of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. [[MindFreedom International]] started an online campaign and many people wrote to [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]. Whitaker was reinvited and delivered his address.<ref>{{cite web|title=What About Bob? USA Mental Health Agency May Cancel Journalist Robert B.

<title>Ancient Egyptian multiplication</title>
<text>{{unreferenced|date=September 2010}}
In [[mathematics]], '''ancient Egyptian multiplication''' (also known as '''Egyptian multiplication''', '''Ethiopian multiplication''', '''Russian multiplication''', or '''peasant multiplication'''), one of two multiplication methods used by scribes, was a systematic method for multiplying two numbers that does not require the [[multiplication table]], only the ability to multiply and [[division by 2|divide by 2]], and to [[addition|add]]. It decomposes one of the [[multiplicand]]s (generally the larger) into a sum of [[powers of two]] and creates a table of doublings of the second multiplicand. This method may be called '''mediation and duplation''', where [[division by two|mediation]] means halving one number and duplation means doubling the other number. It is still used in some areas.

The second [[Egyptian multiplication and division]] technique was known from the [[hieratic]] [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus|Moscow]] and [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus|Rhind Mathematical Papyri]] written in the seventeenth century B.C. by the scribe [[Ahmes]].

== The decomposition ==

The decomposition into a sum of powers of two was not intended as a change from base ten to base two; the [[Egyptians]] then were unaware of such concepts and had to resort to much simpler methods. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians had laid out tables of a great number of powers of two so as not to be obliged to recalculate them each time.  The decomposition of a number thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up.  The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number.  For the decomposition, they proceeded methodically; they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question, subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained.  (The Egyptians did not make use of the number zero in mathematics).

To find the largest power of 2 keep doubling your answer starting with number 1.<br/>

Example:<br/>
<br/>
1 x 2 = 2<br/>
2 x 2 = 4<br/>
4 x 2 = 8<br/>
8 x 2 = 16<br/>
16 x 2 = 32 <br/>

Example of the decomposition of the number 25:
* the largest power of two less than or equal to 25 is 16,
* 25 – 16 = 9,
* the largest power of two less than or equal to 9 is 8,
* 9 – 8 = 1,
* the largest power of two less than or equal to 1 is 1,
* 1 – 1 = 0

25 is thus the sum of the powers of two: 16, 8 and 1.

== The table ==
After the decomposition of the first multiplicand, it is necessary to construct a table of powers of two times the second multiplicand (generally the smaller) from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition.  In the table, a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two.

For example, if the largest power of two found during the decomposition is 16, and the second multiplicand is 7, the table is created as follows:
* 1; 7
* 2; 14
* 4; 28
* 8; 56
* 16; 112

== The result ==
The result is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of the first multiplicand.

The main advantage of this technique is that it makes use of only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two.

== Example ==
Here, in actual figures, is how 238 is multiplied by 13.  The lines are multiplied by two, from one to the next.  A check mark is placed by the powers of two in the decomposition of 13.

{| border="0"
|-----
| ✓ || 1 || 238
|-----
|
 || 2 || 476
|-----
| ✓ || 4 || 952
|-----
| ✓ || 8 || 1904
|-----
| colspan="8" | <hr/>
|-----
|
 || 13 || 3094
|}

Since 13 = 8 + 4 + 1, distribution of multiplication over addition gives 13 × 238 = (8 + 4 + 1) × 238 = 8 x 238 + 4 × 238 + 1 × 238 = 1904 + 952 + 238 = 3094.

'''Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Никола́евич Колмого́ров}}) (25 April 1903 – 20 October 1987) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Russian [[mathematician]], preeminent in the 20th century, who advanced various scientific fields, among them [[probability theory]], [[topology]], [[intuitionistic logic]], [[turbulence]], [[classical mechanics]] and [[computational complexity]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kolmogorov was born at [[Tambov]] in 1903. His unwed mother died in childbirth and he was raised by his aunts in [[Tunoshna]] near [[Yaroslavl]] at the estate of his grandfather, a wealthy nobleman. His father, an [[agronomist]] by trade, was deported from [[Saint-Petersburg]] for participation in the revolutionary movement. He disappeared and was presumed to have been killed in the [[Russian Civil War]]. 

Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt's village school, and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school newspaper. As an adolescent he designed [[perpetual motion]] machines, concealing their (necessary) defects so cleverly that his secondary-school teachers could not discover them. In 1910, his aunt adopted him and then they moved to Moscow, where he went to a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], graduating from it in 1920. 

In 1920, Kolmogorov began to study at the [[Moscow State University]] and the Chemistry Technological Institute. 

Kolmogorov gained a reputation for his wide-ranging erudition.  As an undergraduate, he participated in the seminars of the Russian historian S.V. Bachrushin, and he published his first research paper on the [[Landowner|landholding]] practices in the [[Novgorod|Novgorod Republic]] in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<ref>David Salsburg, ''The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century,'' New York, W. H. Freeman, 2001; pp. 137&amp;ndash;50.</ref> At the same time (1921&amp;ndash;1922), Kolmogorov derived and proved several results in [[set theory]] and in the theory of [[Fourier series]] (trigonometrical series).

===Maturity===
In 1922 Kolmogorov constructed a [[Convergence of Fourier series|Fourier series that diverges]] [[almost everywhere]], gaining international recognition. Around this time he decided to devote his life to [[mathematics]]. In 1925 Kolmogorov graduated from  [[Moscow State University]], and began to study under the supervision of [[Nikolai Luzin]]. He made lifelong friends with [[Pavel Alexandrov]] who involved Kolmogorov in 1936 in an ugly  political persecution of their common teacher, the so-called [[Luzin case]] or [[Luzin affair]]. Kolmogorov (together with [[Khinchin|A. Khinchin]]) became interested in [[probability theory]]. Also in 1925, he published his famous work in [[intuitionistic logic]] &amp;mdash; ''On the principle of the excluded middle''. In 1929 Kolmogorov earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree, [[Ph.D.]], at the [[Moscow State University]].

In 1930, Kolmogorov went on his first long trip abroad, traveling to [[Göttingen]] and [[Munich]], Germany, and then to Paris, France. His pioneering work ''About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory'' was published (in German) in 1931. Also in 1931, he became a professor at Moscow University. In 1933, Kolmogorov published the book, ''Foundations of the Theory of Probability'', laying the modern axiomatic [[probability axioms|foundations of probability theory]] and establishing his reputation as the world's leading living expert in this field. In 1935, Kolmogorov became the first chairman of probability theory at the [[Moscow State University]]. In 1939, he was elected a full member (academician) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]]. In a 1938 paper, Kolmogorov "established the basic theorems for smoothing and predicting stationary [[stochastic processes]]" — a paper that would have major military applications during the [[Cold War]] to come.<ref>Salsburg, p. 139.</ref> Around the same years (1936) Kolmogorov contributed to the field of ecology and generalized the [[Lotka-Volterra]] model of [[predator-prey]] systems. 

In his study of [[stochastic processes]] (random processes), especially [[Markov process]]es, Kolmogorov and the [[British people|British]] mathematician [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, the [[Chapman–Kolmogorov equation]]s.  

[[Image:Kolm complexity lect.jpg|thumb|Kolmogorov (left) works on his talk ([[Tallinn]], [[Estonian SSR]], 1973).]]
[[Image:Kolm lect prep.jpg|thumb|Kolmogorov works on his talk ([[Tallinn]], [[Estonian SSR]], 1973).]]

Later on, Kolmogorov changed his research interests to the area of [[turbulence]], where his publications beginning in 1941 had a significant influence on the field. In [[classical mechanics]], he is best known for the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] (first presented in 1954 at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]). In 1957 he solved [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]] (a joint work with his student [[V. I. Arnold]]).  He was a founder of [[algorithmic complexity theory]], often referred to as [[Kolmogorov complexity|Kolmogorov complexity theory]], which he began to develop around this time.  

Kolmogorov was married to Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942. He pursued a vigorous teaching routine throughout his life, not only at the university level but also with younger children, as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children, in literature, and in music, as well as in mathematics. At the Moscow State University, Kolmogorov occupied different positions, including the heads of several departments: [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[random process]]es; [[mathematical logic]]; and he also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics.

In 1971, Kolmogorov joined an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] expedition aboard the research vessel '''Dmitri Mendeleev'''. He wrote a number of articles for the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].'' In his later years he devoted much of his effort to the mathematical and philosophical relationship between [[probability theory]] in abstract and applied areas.<ref>Salsburg, pp. 145&amp;ndash;7.</ref>

Kolmogorov died in Moscow in 1987. A quotation, "Every mathematician believes he is ahead over all others. The reason why they don't say this in public, is because they are intelligent people" is attributed to him.

The [[Android Dev Phone]] is a [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]]-unlocked and hardware-unlocked device that is designed for advanced developers. While developers can use regular consumer devices purchased at retail to test and use their applications, some developers may choose not to use a retail device, preferring an unlocked or no-contract device.

===Software development kit===
The Android [[software development kit]] (SDK) includes a comprehensive set of development tools.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/index.html |title = Tools Overview |work = Android Developers |date = 21 July 2009}}</ref> These include a [[debugger]], [[Software library|libraries]], a handset [[emulator]] (based on [[QEMU]]), documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Currently supported development platforms include computers running [[Linux kernel|Linux]] (any modern desktop [[List of GNU/Linux distributions|Linux distribution]]), [[Mac OS X]] 10.4.9 or later, [[Windows XP]] or later. The officially supported [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) is [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] (currently 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6) using the Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin, though developers may use any text editor to edit Java and XML files then use [[command line]] tools ([[Java Development Kit]] and [[Apache Ant]] are required) to create, build and debug Android applications as well as control attached Android devices (e.g., triggering a reboot, installing software package(s) remotely).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jonwestfall.com/2009/08/backup-restore-android-apps-using-adb/ |title = Backup &amp; Restore Android Apps Using ADB |first = Jon |last = Westfall |date = 25 August 2009 |work = JonWestfall.com |accessdate =2009-12-07}}</ref>

A preview release of the Android SDK was released on 12 November 2007. On 15 July 2008, the Android Developer Challenge Team accidentally sent an email to all entrants in the Android Developer Challenge announcing that a new release of the SDK was available in a "private" download area. The email was intended for winners of the first round of the Android Developer Challenge. The revelation that Google was supplying new SDK releases to some developers and not others (and keeping this arrangement private) led to widely reported frustration within the Android developer community at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/14/android_developer_unrest/ |title=Google plays Hide and Seek with Android SDK |first=Cade |last=Metz |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-23 |work=[[The Register]]}}</ref>

On 18 August 2008 the Android 0.9 SDK beta was released. This release provided an updated and extended API, improved development tools and an updated design for the home screen. Detailed instructions for upgrading are available to those already working with an earlier release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/android/intro/upgrading.html |title=Android — An Open Handset Alliance Project: Upgrading the SDK |accessdate=2008-10-24}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> On 23 September 2008 the Android 1.0 SDK (Release 1) was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/older_releases.html |title=Other SDK Releases |accessdate=2009-09-02 |work=Android Developers}}</ref> According to the release notes, it included "mainly bug fixes, although some smaller features were added". It also included several API changes from the 0.9 version. Multiple versions have been released since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/older_releases.html |title=SDK Archives}}</ref>

Enhancements to Android's SDK go hand in hand with the overall Android platform development. The SDK also supports older versions of the Android platform in case developers wish to target their applications at older devices. Development tools are downloadable components, so after one has downloaded the latest version and platform, older platforms and tools can also be downloaded for compatibility testing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html |title=SDK Tools}}</ref>

Android applications are packaged in [[APK (file format)|.apk]] format  and stored under <code>/data/app</code> folder on the Android OS (the folder is accessible to root user only for security reasons). APK package contains .dex files<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/glossary.html |title=Android SDK Glossary}}</ref> (compiled byte code files called [[Dalvik Virtual Machine|Dalvik]] executable), resource files, etc.

===Android Market===
{{Main|Android Market}}
Android Market is the online software store developed by Google for Android devices. An application program ("app") called "Market" is preinstalled on most Android devices and allows users to browse and download apps published by third-party developers, hosted on Android Market. {{As of|2010|December}} there were about 200,000 games, applications and widgets available on the Android Market, with an estimated 2.5 billion total downloads.<ref name="200,000">{{cite web |title=Android App Stats|url=http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx|accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref>

Only devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements are allowed to preinstall Google's closed-source Android Market app and access the Market.<ref>{{Cite web

Google announced the Android Market on 28 August 2008, and it was available to users on 22 October 2008. Support for paid applications was available from 13 February 2009 for US and UK developers,<ref>{{cite web |title=Android Market Update Support |url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/02/android-market-update-support-for.html}}</ref> with additional support from 29 countries on 30 September 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title= More Countries More Sellers More Buyers|url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html}}</ref>

On 12 July 2010 Google announced the availability of App Inventor for Android, a Web-based visual development environment for novice programmers, based on MIT's Open Blocks Java library and providing access to Android devices' GPS, accelerometer and orientation data, phone functions, text messaging, speech-to-text conversion, contact data, persistent storage, and Web services, initially including Amazon and Twitter.<ref>{{cite news |last=Claburn |first=Thomas |title=Google App Inventor Simplifies Android Programming |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/smb/mobile/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=225702880&amp;subSection=News |accessdate=2010-07-12 |newspaper=Information Week |date=2010-07-12}}</ref> "We could only have done this because Android’s architecture is so open," said the project director, MIT's [[Hal Abelson]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lohr |first=Steve |title=Google’s Do-It-Yourself App Creation Software |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/technology/12google.html?src=busln |accessdate=2010-07-12 |newspaper=New York Times |date=2010-07-11}}</ref> Under development for over a year,<ref>{{cite news |last=Abelson |first=Hal |title=App Inventor for Android|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/07/app-inventor-for-android.html |accessdate=2010-07-12 |newspaper=Google Research Blog |date=2009-07-31}}</ref> the block-editing tool has been taught to non-majors in computer science at Harvard, MIT, Wellesley, and the University of San Francisco, where Professor David Wolber developed an introductory computer science course and tutorial book for non-computer science students based on App Inventor for Android.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kim|first=Ryan |title=Google brings app-making to the masses |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-12-11/business/17220628_1_computer-science-smart-phone-android |accessdate=2010-07-12 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2009-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wolber |first=David |title=AppInventor.org |url=http://www.appinventor.org/ |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>

===Android Developer Challenge===
{{Main|Android Developer Challenge}}
The Android Developer Challenge was a competition for the most innovative application for Android. Google offered prizes totaling 10 million [[US dollar]]s, distributed between ADC I and ADC II. ADC I accepted submissions from 2 January to 14 April 2008. The 50 most promising entries, announced on 12 May 2008, each received a $25,000 award to fund further development.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/05/top-50-applications.html |work = Android Developers Blog |title = The Top 50 Applications |first = Jason |last = Chen |date = 12 May 2008 |accessdate = 2009-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3168326017.html |title = Android Developer Challenge announces first-round winners |work = Linux for Devices |first = Eric |last = Brown |date = 13 May 2008}}</ref> It ended in early September with the announcement of ten teams that received $275,000 each, and ten teams that received $100,000 each.<ref name="ADC">{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/android/adc/adc_gallery/ |title=ADC I Top 50 Gallery |accessdate=2009-05-19 |work=Android Developer Challenge}}</ref> ADC II was announced on 27 May 2009.<ref name="Challenge">{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/android/adc/ |title=Android Developer Challenge |accessdate=2008-01-11 |work=Google Code}}</ref> The first round of the ADC II closed on 6 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/10/adc-2-round-1-scoring-complete.html |title = ADC 2 Round 1 Scoring Complete |work = Android Developers Blog |first = Eric |last = Chu |date = 6 October 2009 |accessdate =2009-11-03}}</ref> The first-round winners of ADC II comprising the top 200 applications were announced on 5 November 2009.

===Google applications===
Google has also participated in the Android Market by offering several applications for its services. These applications include [[Google Voice]] for the Google Voice service, Sky Map for watching stars, Finance for their finance service, Maps Editor for their MyMaps service, Places Directory for their Local Search, [[Google Goggles]] that searches by image, Gesture Search for using finger written letters and numbers to search the contents of the phone, Google Translate, Google Shopper, Listen for podcasts and My Tracks, a jogging application.

In August 2010, Google launched "Voice Actions for Android",<ref>[http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/index.html Voice Actions for Android]</ref> which allows users to search, write messages, and initiate calls by voice.

===Third party applications===
With the growing number of Android handsets, there has also been an increased interest by third party developers to port their applications to the Android operating system.

As of December 2010, the Android Marketplace had over 200,000 applications,<ref name="200,000" /> with over 1 billion downloads. This is up from 70,000 in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/15/android-market-now-has-100-000-apps-passes-1-billion-download-m/ |title=Android Market Has 100,000 Apps &amp; Passes 1 Billion Downloads |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fonehome.co.uk/2010/07/16/android-market-hits-1-billion-downloads-100000-apps/ |title=Android Market Hits 1 Billion Downloads &amp; 100,000 apps |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>

Obstacles to development include the fact that Android does not use established Java standards, i.e. [[Java SE]] and [[Java ME|ME]]. This prevents compatibility among Java applications written for those platforms and those for the Android platform. Android only reuses the Java language syntax, but does not provide the full-class libraries and APIs bundled with Java SE or ME.<ref>{{cite web

===Native code===
Libraries written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages can be compiled to [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[native code]] and installed using the Android [[Native Development Kit]]. Native classes can be called from Java code running under the Dalvik VM using the <code>System.loadLibrary</code> call, which is part of the standard Android Java classes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://davanum.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/android-invoke-jni-based-methods-bridging-cc-and-java/ |title=Android — Invoke JNI based methods (Bridging C/C++ and Java) |last=Srinivas |first=Davanum |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System.html |title=java.lang.System |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>

ARM code can be compiled using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] on a standard PC.<ref name="benno"/> Running native code is complicated by the fact that Android uses a non-standard C library (libc, known as [[Bionic (libc)|Bionic]]). The underlying graphics device is available as a [[framebuffer]] at ''/dev/graphics/fb0''.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/msg/ace258af92fff692?dmode=source&amp;pli=1 |title=Native C *GRAPHICAL* applications now working on Android emulator |last=Cooksey |first=Tom |mailinglist=android-developers |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref> The graphics library that Android uses to arbitrate and control access to this device is called the [[Skia Graphics Engine|Skia Graphics Library]] (SGL), and it has been released under an open source license.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/skia/|title=Skia source}}</ref> Skia has backends for both [[win32]] and [[Unix]], allowing the development of cross-platform applications, and it is the graphics engine underlying the [[Google Chrome]] web browser.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atoker.com/blog/2008/09/06/skia-graphics-library-in-chrome-first-impressions/ |title=Skia graphics library in Chrome: First impressions |last=Toker |first=Alp |date=2008-09-06 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref>

===Community-based firmware===
There is a community of open-source enthusiasts that build and share Android-based firmware with a number of customizations and additional features, such as [[FLAC]] lossless audio support and the ability to store downloaded applications on the [[microSD]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=448 |work=xda-developers forum |title=Dream android development |accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> This usually involves [[Rooting (Android OS)|rooting]] the device. Rooting allows users root access to the operating system, giving more control over their environment variables. In order to use custom firmwares the devices bootloader must be unlocked. Rooting alone does not allow the flashing of custom firmware. Modified firmwares allow users of older phones to use applications available only on newer releases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voltmobileandtech.com/blog/ |title= Android 2.1 from Motorola Droid Ported to G1 |work=[[Volt Mobile]] |date= March 10, 2010}}</ref>

Those firmware packages are updated frequently, incorporate elements of Android functionality that haven't yet been officially released within a carrier-sanctioned firmware, and tend to have fewer limitations. [[CyanogenMod]] and [[VillainROM]] are two examples of such firmware.

On 24 September 2009, Google issued a [[cease and desist]] letter<ref>{{cite web |url = http://androidandme.com/2009/09/hacks/cyanogenmod-in-trouble/ |title = CyanogenMod in trouble? |work = Android and me |first = Taylor |last = Wimberly |date = 24 September 2009 |accessdate = 2009-09-26}}</ref> to the modder Cyanogen, citing issues with the re-distribution of Google's closed-source applications<ref>{{cite web |url = http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/09/note-on-google-apps-for-android.html |title = A Note on Google Apps for Android |work = Android Developers Blog |first = Dan |last = Morrill |date = 25 September 2009 |accessdate =2009-09-26}}</ref> within the custom firmware. Even though most of  Android OS is open source, phones come packaged with closed-source Google applications for functionality such as the application store and GPS navigation. Google has asserted that these applications can only be provided through approved distribution channels by licensed distributors. Cyanogen has complied with Google's wishes and is continuing to distribute this mod without the proprietary software. He has provided a method to back up licensed Google applications during the mod's install process and restore them when it is complete.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/the-current-state |title = The current state... |work = CyanogenMod Android Rom |first = Cyanogen |date = 27 September 2009 |accessdate =2009-09-27}}</ref>

Google announced in April 2010 that they will hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=6274 |title=DiBona: Google will hire two Android coders to work with kernel.org |date=15 April 2010 |work=www.zdnet.com |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref>

However, as of January 2011, points of contention still exist between Google and the Linux kernel team: Google tried to push [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] some Android-specific power management code in 2009, which is still rejected today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/344486-garretta-linuxcon-talk-emphasizes-lessons-learned-from-androidkernel-saga |title=Garrett's LinuxCon Talk Emphasizes Lessons Learned from Android/Kernel Saga  |date=2011-08-10 |publisher=[[Linux.com]] quote=''Garrett, whose field of expertise is power management at Red Hat, nonetheless admitted that when he first saw the patch submitted by Android, he didn't even know what the patch was trying to fix and what specific functions were being called in the patch. New undefined terms, such as "wakelock" and "earlysuspend," were intermixed in the original January 2009 patch submittal to the mainline kernel, making the patch very hard to understand(...)There were questions about the very motivation of the patch: with the undefined terms, kernel developers were unsure what problem was being addressed and if the problem would even apply to the Linux kernel as a whole(...)As for Android's patch, a minimal solution has been introduced to the mainline, but their proposed changes are still pending.''| |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

Furthermore, [[Greg Kroah-Hartman]], the current Linux kernel maintainer for the -stable branch, said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html |title = Android and the Linux kernel community |date = 2010-12-09 |author=[[Greg Kroah-Hartman]] |quote=''Google shows no sign of working to get their code upstream anymore. Some companies are trying to strip the Android-specific interfaces from their codebase and push that upstream, but that causes a much larger engineering effort, and is a pain that just should not be necessary(...)As for me, I think I'll look into getting a Nokia N900. It looks much more open, with the code mostly all upstream, and a much more active developer community.''. |accessdate = 2011-01-02}}</ref> Some Google Android developers hinted that "the Android team were getting fed up with the process", because they were a small team and had more urgent work to do on Android.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.computerworld.com/16900/android_linux_kernel_fight_continues |title = Android/Linux kernel fight continues |date = 2010-09-07 |publisher=[[Computerworld]] |quote=''Unfortunately, according to Ts'o, time is not something the Android team has a lot of. They're too busy running to keep up with hardware requirements. Ts'o said that, although, "There's less than 64K of patch, there's been over 1,800 mail messages of discussion." Ts'o made it sound like the Android team is getting fed up with the process. "Android is a small team. They feel that they're spending a vast amount of time getting the code upstream (to the main Linux kernel)."'' |accessdate = 2011-01-02}}</ref>

==Claimed infringement of copyrights and patents==
On 12 August 2010, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], owner of Java since it acquired [[Sun Microsystems]] in April 2009, sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents. The lawsuit claims that, "In developing Android, Google knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle's Java-related intellectual property."<ref name="computerworld">{{cite web

Specifically the patent infringement claim references seven patents including United States Patent No. 5,966,702,
entitled "Method And Apparatus For Preprocessing And Packaging Class Files", and United States Patent No. 6,910,205, entitled "Interpreting Functions Utilizing A Hybrid Of Virtual And Native Machine Instructions".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/35811761/Oracle-s-complaint-against-Google-for-Java-patent-infringement |title=Oracle's complaint against Google for Java patent infringement |publisher=scribd.com |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> It also references United States Patent No. RE38,104, ("the '104 patent") entitled “Method And Apparatus For Resolving Data References In Generated Code” authored by [[James Gosling]], best known as the father of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]].<ref>{{cite web

In response Google submitted multiple lines of defense, saying that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android is based on [[Apache Harmony]], a [[Clean room design|clean room]] implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]].<ref>{{Cite web

The [[Free Software Foundation]] has said that Google could have avoided this suit by building Android on top of [[IcedTea]] whose [[GPL license]] provides some protection against patents, instead of implementing it independently under the [[Apache License]]. It has also called the suit a "clear attack against someone's freedom to use, share, modify, and redistribute software".<ref name='ogfsf'>{{cite web

<title>Android science</title>
<text>'''Android science''' is an interdisciplinary framework for studying human interaction and cognition based on the premise that a very humanlike [[robot]] (that is, an [[Android (robot)|android]]) can elicit human-directed social responses in human beings.<ref>Reeves, B. &amp; Nass, C. (2002). ''The media equation: How people treat computers, television, and new media like real people and places.'' University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-1-57586-053-4</ref><ref>MacDorman, K. F., Minato, T., Shimada, M., Itakura, S., Cowley, S. J., &amp; Ishiguro, H. (2005). Assessing human likeness by eye contact in an android testbed. In ''Proceedings of the XXVII Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society.'' July 25–26, Stresa, Italy.</ref> The android's ability to elicit human-directed social responses enables researchers to employ an android in experiments with human participants as an apparatus that can be controlled more precisely than a human actor.<ref>[http://www.macdorman.com MacDorman, K. F.] &amp; [http://www.ed.ams.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/ Ishiguro, H.] (2006). [http://www.macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/MacDorman2006AndroidScience.pdf The uncanny advantage of using androids in cognitive science research.] ''Interaction Studies, 7''(3), 297-337.</ref>

While mechanical-looking robots may be able to elicit social responses to some extent, a robot that looks and acts like a human being is in a better position to stand in for a human actor in social, psychological, cognitive, or neuroscientific experiments.<ref>[http://www.macdorman.com MacDorman, K. F.] &amp; [http://www.ed.ams.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/ Ishiguro, H.] (2006). [http://www.macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/MacDorman2006OpeningPandorasUncannyBox.pdf Opening Pandora’s uncanny box: Reply to commentaries on “The uncanny advantage of using androids in social and cognitive science research.”] Interaction Studies, 7(3), 361-368.</ref> This gives experiments with androids a level of ecological validity with respect to human interaction found lacking in experiments with mechanical-looking robots.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1075/is.7.3.03mac}}</ref>

An experimental setting for human-android interaction also provides a testing ground for models concerning how cognitive or neural processing influence human interaction, because models can be implemented in the android and tested in interaction with human participants. In android science, cognitive science and engineering are understood as enjoying a synergistic relationship in which the results from a deepening understanding of human interaction and the development of increasingly humanlike androids feed into each other.<ref>Ishiguro, H. (2005). Android science: Toward a new cross-disciplinary framework. In ''Toward social mechanisms of android science: A CogSci 2005 Workshop.'' July 25–26, Stresa, Italy, pp. 1-6.</ref>

Some researchers{{Who|date=August 2009}} broadly construe android science to include all the effects of engineered human likeness, such as the impact of humanlike robots on society or the study of the relationship between [[anthropomorphism]] and human perception. The latter relates to an observation made by [[Masahiro Mori]] that human beings are more sensitive to deviations from humanlike behavior or appearance in near-human forms. Mori refers to this phenomenon as the [[uncanny valley]].<ref>Mori, M. (1970). Bukimi no tani (The uncanny valley; K. F. MacDorman &amp; T. Minato, Trans.). ''Energy, 7''(4), 33–35.</ref> In android science this heightened sensitivity is seen as a diagnostic tool for enhancing the human likeness of an android.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

__NOTOC__
'''Andrew Neil (Andy) Blumenthal''' is chief technology officer at the [http://www.atf.gov Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] (ATF).

== Background ==
Previously, Blumenthal served at the [http://www.dhs.gov Department of Homeland Security], as director of enterprise architecture and IT governance for the [http://www.uscg.mil United States Coast Guard] and prior to that as chief enterprise architect at the [http://www.usss.gov United States Secret Service]. In 2005, Blumenthal authored “Implementing Enterprise Architecture at the United States Secret Service,”[1] a case study in User-Centric Enterprise Architecture, a methodology he founded. In 2008, he expanded on the approach in “An Introduction to User-centric Enterprise Architecture” [2]. “User-Centric EA” treats enterprise architecture as a business tool for executive decision-making. In 2009, Blumenthal created the CIO Support Services Framework and described this framework in a two-part article, “How to Strengthen the Office of the CIO.” [3] The approach integrates six major components required by CIOs to manage the IT function. He lectures at [http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/index.aspx Carnegie Mellon University CIO Institute] and the [http://www.ndu.edu/irmc/ National Defense University Information Resources Management College]. 
Blumenthal was interviewed about the role of the CTO by [http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=19&amp;sid=1597862 Federal News Radio] in 2009.

'''Andy Gavin''' (born 1970) is a programmer notable for co-founding the video game company [[Naughty Dog]] with childhood friend [[Jason Rubin]] in 1986. [[Naughty Dog]]'s games (most famously, [[Crash Bandicoot]]) are known for their combination of exceptional technology, great graphics, and polished gameplay.<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.05/deathmatch.html?pg=2</ref>  The sophistication of [[Naughty Dog]] technology is often credited to Gavin's background in [[LISP]] at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].<ref>http://www.franz.com/success/customer_apps/animation_graphics/naughtydog.lhtml</ref>

==Education==
Gavin studied for his Ph.D. at M.I.T. where he did research for the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on the Mars Rover Vision Project, under his advisor [[Rod Brooks]].  While still a student, Gavin learned the computer programming language [[LISP]].  Influences from M.I.T. and his own work lead him to develop a number of custom programming languages that improved the quality of graphics, controls, sounds and artificial intelligence in [[Naughty Dog]] video games.  He also has a B.S. from [[Haverford College]] in Neuro Biological Science.<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19991112/GavinWhite_03.htm</ref>

==Career==
Together, Gavin and Rubin sold their first video game called Math Jam in 1985. A few games later they sold Keef the Thief [http://www.mobygames.com/game/keef-the-thief-a-boy-and-his-lockpick] in 1989 to [[Electronic Arts]].  In the early 90’s, they created a fighting game called [[Way of the Warrior]] which eventually led to a multi-title deal with Universal Interactive Studios.<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.02/eword.html?pg=7</ref>  It was under the auspices of this Universal deal that they produced the multi-million selling [[Crash Bandicoot]] series from 1994 until 1999, and later segueing into the successful [[Jak and Daxter]] series of games. At the end of 2000, Rubin and Gavin sold [[Naughty Dog]] to [[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] (SCEA).  All in all, they created 14 [[Naughty Dog]] games including Math Jam (1985), Ski Crazed (1986), [[Dream Zone]] (1987), Keef the Thief (1989), [[Rings of Power]] (1991), [[Way of the Warrior]] (1994), [[Crash Bandicoot]] (1996), Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back (1997), Crash Bandicoot: Warped (1998), Crash Team Racing (1999), [[Jak and Daxter]]: The Precursor Legacy (2001), Jak 2 (2003), Jak 3 (2004) and Jak X: Combat Racing (2005). Together these games have sold over 35 million units and generated over $1 billion in revenue.[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/devs-dont-need-producers-naughty-dog]

While at [[Naughty Dog]], Gavin developed two LISP dialects for use in game development, GOOL (Game Object Oriented Lisp) and its successor [[Game Oriented Assembly Lisp|GOAL]] (Game Oriented Assembly Lisp).  These represented a departure from the mainstream in terms of language choice, and featured some innovations in design.<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naughty_dogs_jak_and_.php?page=2</ref>

</gallery>

Shortly after leaving Naughty Dog, Gavin co-founded a new Internet startup called [[Flektor]] with his former business partner, [[Jason Rubin]], and former HBO executive Jason R. Kay. In May 2007, the company was sold to [[Fox Interactive Media]], which is a division of [[News Corp.]]<ref>http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/06/26/flektor/index.html</ref>  Fox has described the company as: “a next-generation Web site that provides users with a suite of Web-based tools to transform their photos and videos into dynamic slideshows, postcards, live interactive presentations and video mash-ups.”  In October 2007, [[Flektor]] partnered with its sister company, [[MySpace]], and [[MTV]] to provide instant audience feedback via polls for the interactive MySpace / MTV Presidential Dialogues series with then-presidential candidate Senator [[Barack Obama]].<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1572991/20071029/index.jhtml</ref>  

Gavin left Fox Interactive Media in 2008. He recently announced a return to the video game business with his [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. They have formed a new social game startup called [[Monkey Gods]] that is working on a new version of [[Snood (video game)|Snood]] along with a casual word game called MonkWerks [http://www.monkwerks.com].<ref>http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/14/crash-bandicoot-creators-speak-out-on-forming-new-game-company/</ref>

<title>Andy Hertzfeld</title>
<text>'''Andy Hertzfeld''' (born April 6, 1953) was a key member of the original [[Apple Macintosh]] development team during the 1980s. After buying an Apple II in January 1978, he went to work for [[Apple Computer]] from August 1979 until March 1984, where he was a key designer of the [[Macintosh]] system software. Since leaving Apple, he has co-founded three companies: [[Radius (computer)|Radius]] in 1986, [[General Magic]] in 1990 and [[Eazel]] in 1999. In 2002, he helped [[Mitch Kapor]] promote [[open source]] [[software]] with the [[Open Source Applications Foundation]]. Hertzfeld joined [[Google]] in 2005 and has been working there since.

==Career==
===Apple Computer (1979–1984)===
[[Image:Mac Design Team.jpg|thumb|Part of the original Macintosh design team, as seen on the cover of ''Revolution in the Valley''.<br />Left to right: [[George Crow]], [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Burrell Smith]], Andy Hertzfeld, [[Bill Atkinson]], [[Jerry Manock]].]]
After graduating from [[Brown University]] with a [[Computer science|Computer Science]] degree in 1975, Hertzfeld attended [[graduate school]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1978, he bought an [[Apple II]] computer and soon began developing software for it. He was hired by Apple Computer as a systems programmer in 1979 and developed the [[Apple SilenType]] printer [[firmware]] and the first 80-column card for the Apple II. In the early 1980s, he invited his high school friend, artist [[Susan Kare]], to join Apple in order to help design what would become standard Macintosh icons.

Hertzfeld's business card at Apple listed his title as ''Software Wizard''. He wrote large portions of the Macintosh's original system software including much of the burned-in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code, the User Interface Toolbox, and a number of innovative components now standard in many graphic user interfaces, like the [[Control panel (Mac OS)|Control Panel]] and [[Scrapbook (Mac OS)|Scrapbook]].

After a shakeup in the Apple II team and at Hertzfeld's request, Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] added him to the newly formed Macintosh team in February, 1981. Working for [[Bud Tribble]] alongside [[Bill Atkinson]] and [[Burrell Smith]], Hertzfeld became a primary software architect of the [[Mac OS|Macintosh Operating System]], which was considered revolutionary in its use of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) where [[Jef Raskin]] also made significant contributions.

===After Apple (1984–present)===
Since leaving Apple in 1984, Hertzfeld has co-founded three new companies &amp; mdash; [[Radius (computer)|Radius]] (1986), [[General Magic]] (1990) and [[Eazel]] (1999). At Eazel, he helped to create the [[Nautilus file manager]] for [[Linux|Linux's]] [[GNOME]] desktop. He volunteered for [[OSAF]] in 2002 and 2003, writing early prototypes of ''[[Chandler (PIM)|Chandler]]'', their information manager. In 1996, Hertzfeld was interviewed by [[Robert Cringely]] on the television show ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'', and was again interviewed by Cringely on NerdTV in 2005.

In early 2004, he started ''folklore.org'', a [[web site]] devoted to collective storytelling that contains dozens of [[anecdote]]s about the development of the original Macintosh. The stories have been collected in an [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] book, ''Revolution in the Valley'', published in December 2004. In August 2005, Hertzfeld joined [[Google]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/technology/22google.html | work=The New York Times | title=Where Does Google Plan to  Spend $4 Billion? | first=John | last=Markoff | date=August 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref>

<title>Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions)</title>
<text>{{Unreferenced|date=March 2010}}
{{Merge|The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|date=March 2010}}
'''Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions)''' is a fictional robot appearing in the [[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla]] of Stephen King's [[Dark Tower]] series.  He is approximately 7 feet tall, has very large data banks and dictionaries, can reproduce music, and is superhumanly strong and  near superhumanly fast.  He was made by Lamerk Industries an indeterminate number of years ago (Andy says that he may have been built more than two thousand years before).

Andy seems to enjoy talking to the people of the Calla; in fact some of the people mention that he sometimes will not shut up.  He tells horoscopes, although they seem to be in the same vein as horoscopes one might find in a newspaper.

[[Roland Deschain]] and his ka-tet encounter Andy, along with a few villagers, a few miles outside of [[Calla Bryn Sturgis]], a village that lies along the Beam (their road to the Dark Tower).  While the villagers tend to trust Andy and even thank him for telling them the bad news of the Wolves coming, Roland and his party, partly due to prior experience with [[Blaine the Mono]], tend to distrust the intent behind his words.

Andy turns out to be the primary antagonist of the book, being the agent of the Red that relays information to a [[taheen]] named Finli o'Tego in Thunderclap.  Additionally he seems to act as Ben Slightman's handler, as Ben is also reporting on events in the Calla, especially the events surrounding Roland and his ka-tet.

In [[3D computer graphics]], '''anisotropic filtering''' (abbreviated '''AF''') is a method of enhancing the image quality of [[Texture filtering|textures]] on surfaces that are at [[Dutch angle|oblique viewing angles]] with respect to the camera where the projection of the texture (not the polygon or other primitive on which it is rendered) appears to be non-orthogonal (thus the origin of the word: "an" for ''not'', "iso" for ''same'', and "tropic" from [[tropism]], relating to direction; anisotropic filtering does not filter the same in every direction).  Like [[bilinear filtering|bilinear]] and [[trilinear filtering]] it eliminates [[aliasing]] effects, but improves on these other techniques by reducing blur and preserving detail at extreme viewing angles. [[Anisotropic]] filtering is relatively intensive (primarily [[memory bandwidth]] and to some degree [[computation]]ally, though the standard [[space-time tradeoff]] rules apply) and only became a standard feature of consumer-level [[graphics card]]s in the late 1990s. Anisotropic filtering is now common in modern graphics hardware and is enabled either by users through driver settings or by graphics applications and video games through programming interfaces.

==An improvement on isotropic MIP mapping==

Hereafter, it is assumed the reader is familiar with [[mipmap|MIP mapping]].

If we were to explore a more approximate anisotropic algorithm, RIP mapping (rectim in parvo) as an extension from MIP mapping, we can understand how anisotropic filtering gains so much texture mapping quality. If we need to texture a horizontal plane which is at an oblique angle to the camera, traditional MIP map minification would give us insufficient horizontal resolution due to the reduction of image frequency in the vertical axis. This is because in MIP mapping each MIP level is isotropic, so a 256 × 256 texture is downsized to a 128 × 128 image, then a 64 × 64 image and so on, so resolution halves on each axis simultaneously, so a MIP map texture probe to an image will always sample an image that is of equal frequency in each axis. Thus, when sampling to avoid aliasing on a high-frequency axis, the other texture axes will be similarly downsampled and therefore potentially blurred.

With RIP map anisotropic filtering, in addition to downsampling to 128 × 128, images are also sampled to 256 × 128 and 32 × 128 etc. These anisotropically downsampled images can be probed when the texture-mapped image frequency is different for each texture axis and therefore one axis need not blur due to the screen frequency of another axis and aliasing is still avoided. Unlike more general anisotropic filtering, the RIP mapping described for illustration has a limitation in that it only supports anisotropic probes that are axis-aligned in texture space, so diagonal anisotropy still presents a problem even though real-use cases of anisotropic texture commonly have such screenspace mappings.

In layman's terms, anisotropic filtering retains the "sharpness" of a texture normally lost by MIP map texture's attempts to avoid aliasing. Anisotropic filtering can therefore be said to maintain crisp texture detail at all viewing orientations while providing fast anti-aliased texture filtering.

== Degree of anisotropy supported ==

Different degrees or ratios of anisotropic filtering can be applied during rendering and current hardware rendering implementations set an upper bound on this ratio. This degree refers to the maximum ratio of anisotropy supported by the filtering process. So, for example 4:1 (pronounced 4 to 1) anisotropic filtering will continue to sharpen more oblique textures beyond the range sharpened by 2:1. In practice what this means is that in highly oblique texturing situations a 4:1 filter will be twice as sharp as a 2:1 filter (it will display frequencies double that of the 2:1 filter). However, most of the scene will not require the 4:1 filter; only the more oblique and usually more distant pixels will require the sharper filtering. This means that as the degree of anisotropic filtering continues to double there are diminishing returns in terms of visible quality with fewer and fewer rendered pixels affected, and the results become less obvious to the viewer. When one compares the rendered results of an 8:1 anisotropically filtered scene to a 16:1 filtered scene, only a relatively few highly oblique pixels, mostly on more distant geometry, will display visibly sharper textures in the scene with the higher degree of anisotropic filtering, and the frequency information on these few 16:1 filtered pixels will only be double that of the 8:1 filter. The performance penalty also diminishes because fewer pixels require the data fetches of greater anisotropy. In the end it is the additional hardware complexity vs. these diminishing returns, which causes an upper bound to be set on the anisotropic quality in a hardware design. Applications and users are then free to adjust this trade-off through driver and software settings up to this threshold.

==Implementation==

True anisotropic filtering probes the texture anisotropically on the fly on a per-pixel basis for any orientation of anisotropy. In graphics hardware, typically when the texture is sampled anisotropically, several probes ([[texel (graphics)|texel]] samples) of the texture around the center point are taken, but on a sample pattern mapped according to the projected shape of the texture at that pixel. Each probe is often in itself a filtered MIP map sample, which adds more sampling to the process. Sixteen trilinear anisotropic samples might require 128 samples from the stored texture, as trilinear MIP map filtering needs to take four samples times two MIP levels and then anisotropic sampling (at 16-tap) needs to take sixteen of these trilinear filtered probes.

==Performance and optimization==

The sample count required can make anisotropic filtering extremely [[memory bandwidth|bandwidth]]-intensive. Multiple textures are common; each texture sample could be four bytes or more, so each anisotropic pixel could require 512 bytes from texture memory, although [[texture compression]] is commonly used to reduce this. A display can easily contain over a million pixels, and the desired frame rate tends to be as high as 30–60 frames per second or more, so the texture memory bandwidth can get very high (tens to hundreds of gigabytes per second) very quickly. Fortunately, several factors mitigate in favor of better performance. The probes themselves share [[cache]]d texture samples, both inter- and intra-pixel. Even with 16-tap anisotropic filtering, not all 16 taps are always needed, because only distant highly oblique pixel fill tends to be highly anisotropic, and such fill tends to cover small regions of the screen, and finally magnification texture filters require no anisotropic filtering.

<title>Anne Westfall</title>
<text>{{BLP sources|date=November 2008}}

'''Anne Westfall''' is an influential [[game programmer]] of the 1980s.  She is the wife of fellow game programmer, [[game designer]] and [[entrepreneur]] [[Jon Freeman]].<ref name="halcyon">[http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/FREEFALL.HTM Interview with Jon Freeman and Anne Westfall] from ''Halcyon Days''</ref>

==Career==
In 1981, Westfall and her husband Jon, left [[Epyx]], the [[video game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] her husband co-founded just three years earlier.  Westfall cited a desire to learn [[assembly language]] and to work on the [[Atari 800#Original 400.2F800 series|Atari 800]] as one reason for their departure from Epyx.<ref name="halcyon" />

Together with game designer [[Paul Reiche III]], they started [[Free Fall Associates]] to make [[computer game]]s free of the politics existing at the now larger Epyx.<ref name="halcyon" />

For several years,  Westfall was on the [[board of directors]] of the [[Game Developers Conference|Computer Game Developers Conference]].

==Personal==
Westfall met Jon at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in 1980 while demonstrating her surveying program she wrote for the [[TRS-80]].  Her booth was next to Automated Simulations' booth&amp;mdash;later Epyx&amp;mdash;where Jon was working.  After dating for about six months, Freeman convinced Westfall to move closer and come to work at his company.<ref name="halcyon" />

<title>Anomaly-based intrusion detection system</title>
<text>An '''Anomaly-Based''' [[intrusion-detection system|Intrusion Detection System]], is a system for detecting computer intrusions and misuse by monitoring system activity and classifying it as either ''normal'' or ''anomalous''. The classification is based on [[heuristics]] or rules, rather than patterns or [[signature]]s, and will detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature based systems which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created.

In order to determine what is attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognise normal system activity. This can be accomplished in several ways, most often with [[artificial intelligence]] type techniques. Systems using [[neural networks]] have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection.

The patterns thus detected are called anomalies and often translate to critical and actionable information in several application domains. Anomalies are also referred to as [[outlier]]s, surprise, aberrant, deviation, peculiarity, etc. 

Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. Supervised anomaly detection techniques learn a classifier using labeled instances belonging to normal and anomaly class, and then assign a normal or anomalous label to a test instance. Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set, and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the learnt model. Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that majority of the instances in the data set are normal.

== Applications==
Anomaly detection is applicable in a variety of domains, such as [[intrusion detection]], [[fraud detection]], fault detection, system health monitoring, event detection in sensor networks, and detecting eco-system disturbances. It is often used in preprocessing to remove anomalous data from the dataset.

== Popular Anomaly Detection Techniques==
Several anomaly detection techniques have been proposed in literature. Some of the popular techniques are:

* Distance based techniques ([[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]], [[Local Outlier Factor]]).
* One Class [[Support Vector Machines]].
* Replicator [[Neural network|Neural Networks]].
* [[Cluster analysis]] based outlier detection.

== Application to Data Security==
Anomaly detection was proposed for [[Intrusion detection systems]] (IDS) by Dorothy Denning in 1986.<ref>Denning, Dorothy, "An Intrusion Detection Model," Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119-131.</ref>  Anomaly detection for IDS is normally accomplished with thresholds and statistics, but can also be done with [[Soft computing]], and inductive learning<ref>Teng, Henry S., Chen, Kaihu, and Lu, Stephen C-Y, "[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/courses/nidsS05/ai/Teng-AdaptiveRTAnomaly-SnP90.pdf Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection Using Inductively Generated Sequential Patterns]," 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy</ref>.  Types of statistics proposed by 1999 included profiles of users, workstations, networks, remote hosts, groups of users, and programs based on frequencies, means, variances, covariances, and standard deviations.<ref>Jones, Anita K., and Sielken, Robert S., "Computer System Intrusion Detection:  A Survey," Technical Report, Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, 1999</ref>  The counterpart of Anomaly detection in [[Intrusion detection]] is [[Misuse Detection]].

<title>Anonymous P2P</title>
<text>{{Filesharing}}

An '''anonymous P2P''' communication system is a [[peer-to-peer]] distributed application in which the nodes or participants are [[anonymity|anonymous]] or [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]]. Anonymity of participants is usually achieved by special routing [[overlay network]]s that hide the physical location of each node from other participants.

Interest in anonymous P2P systems has increased in recent years for many reasons, ranging from the desire to share [[copyright]]ed files without revealing one's network identity and risking litigation<ref name="eff">Electronic Frontier Foundation (2005). [http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/RIAAatTWO_FINAL.pdf RIAA v. The People: Two Years Later]. Retrieved March 5, 2008.</ref> to distrust in governments, concerns over mass [[surveillance]] and [[data retention]], and lawsuits against [[blog]]gers.<ref name="rsf">Julien Pain, editor (2005). [http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542 Reporters Without Borders handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents]. Retrieved January 23, 2008.</ref>

==Motivation for anonymity==
There are many reasons to use anonymous P2P technology; most of them are generic to all forms of online anonymity.

P2P users who desire anonymity usually do so as they do not wish to be identified as a publisher (sender), or reader (receiver), of information. Common reasons include:

* The material or its distribution is illegal or incriminating
* Material is legal but socially deplored, embarrassing or problematic in the individual's social world (for example, anonymity is seen as a key requirement for organizations like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]])
* Fear of retribution (against whistleblowers, unofficial leaks, and activists who do not believe in restrictions on information or knowledge)
* Censorship at the local, organizational, or national level
* Personal privacy preferences such as preventing [[Web visitor tracking|tracking]] or [[datamining]] activities

A particularly open view on legal and illegal content is given in [http://freenetproject.org/philosophy.html The Philosophy Behind Freenet].

Governments are also interested in anonymous P2P technology. The [[United States]] [[Navy]] funded the original [[onion routing]] research that led to the development of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network, which was later funded by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and is now developed by the non-profit organization The Tor Project, Inc.

==Arguments for and against anonymous P2P communication==
===General===
While anonymous P2P systems may support the protection of unpopular speech, they may also protect illegal activities not protected under some free speech laws, such as [[fraud]], [[slander and libel|libel]], the exchange of illegal [[pornography]], the unauthorized copying of copyrighted works, or the planning of criminal activities. Critics{{Who|date=October 2009}} of anonymous P2P systems hold that the advantages offered by such systems do not outweigh these disadvantages, and that other communication channels are already sufficient for unpopular speech.

Some{{Who|date=October 2009}} proponents of anonymous P2P systems believe that all restrictions on free speech serve authoritarian interests. Others{{Who|date=October 2009}} argue that information itself is ethically neutral, and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil. Perceptions of good and evil can also change (see [[moral panic]]); for example, if anonymous peer-to-peer networks had existed in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have been targeted for carrying information about [[civil rights]] or [[anarchism]].

Easily accessible anonymous P2P networks are seen by some as a democratization of [[encryption]] technology, giving the general populace access to secure communications channels already used by governments. Supporters of this view, such as [[Phil Zimmermann]], argue that anti-surveillance technologies help to equalize power between governments and their people,<ref name="Zimmermann_interview">Russell D. Hoffmann (1996). [http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/philspgp.htm Interview with author of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)]. Transcript of a radio interview, retrieved 2008-01-21.</ref> which is the actual reason for banning them. [[John Pilger|Pilger]] opines that  monitoring of the populace helps to contain threats to the "consensual view of established authority"<ref name="pilger">John Pilger (2002). [http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11340 Impartiality of British Journalism]. ZNet article, retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref> or threats to the continuity of power structures and privilege.

===Freedom of speech===
Some claim that true [[freedom of speech]], especially on controversial subjects, is difficult or impossible unless individuals can speak anonymously. If anonymity is not possible, one could be subjected to threats or reprisals for voicing an unpopular view. This is one reason why voting is done by secret ballot in many democracies. Controversial information which a party wants to keep hidden, such as details about corruption issues, is often published or leaked anonymously.

====Anonymous blogging====
Anonymous blogging is one widespread use of anonymous networks.
While anonymous blogging is possible on the non-anonymous internet to some degree too, a provider hosting the blog in question might be forced to disclose the blogger's IP address (as in the case of Google revealing an anonymous blogger's identity<ref>Declan McCullagh (2007). [http://www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9824638-38.html Google: We had no choice in Israel ID request]. CNET News.com article, retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref>). Anonymous networks provide a better degree of anonymity. Flogs in [[Freenet]], [[Syndie]] in [[I2P]] and [[Osiris (Serverless Portal System)|Osiris sps]] are some examples of anonymous blogging technologies.

One argument for anonymous blogging is a delicate nature of work situation. Sometimes a blogger writing under his/her real name faces a choice between either staying silent or causing a harm to himself, his colleagues or the company he works for.<ref>Bill Vallicella (2004). [http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/07/reasons-for-anonyblogging.html Reasons for 'Anonyblogging']. Maverick Philosopher blog, retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref>

Risk of lawsuits is another reason. Some bloggers have faced multi-million dollar lawsuits<ref>Media Bloggers Association (2006). [http://www.mediabloggers.org/mba-news/mba-member-hit-with-multi-million-dollar-federal-lawsuit MBA Member Hit With Multi-Million Dollar Federal Lawsuit]. Retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref> that were later dropped completely;<ref>Associated Press (2006). [http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2006/05/06/ad_agency_drops_lawsuit_against_maine_blogger/ Ad agency drops lawsuit against Maine blogger]. Retrieved 2008-02-11.</ref> anonymous blogging provides protection against such risks.

====Censorship via Internet domain names====
{{Unclear section|date=April 2009}}
On the non-anonymous internet, a domain name like "mysite.com" is a key to accessing information. The censorship of the Wikileaks website<ref>[http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/WIKILEAKS.INFO_censored_by_eNom_and_Demand_Media WIKILEAKS.INFO censored by eNom and Demand Media]. Retrieved 2008-03-09.</ref>
shows that domain names are extremely vulnerable to censorship. Some domain registrars have suspended customers' domain names even in the absence of a court order.

For the affected customer, blocking of a domain name is a far bigger problem than a registrar refusing to provide a service; typically, the registrar keeps full control over the domain names in question.
In the case of a European travel agency, more than 80 .com web sites were shut down without any court process and held by the registrar since then. The travel agency had to rebuild the sites under the .net [[top-level domain]] instead.<ref>Adam Liptak (2008). [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/us/04bar.html A Wave of the Watch List, and Speech Disappears]. The New York Times, 2008-03-04. Retrieved 2008-03-09.</ref>

Anonymous networks, on the other hand, do not rely on domain name registrars. For example, [[Freenet]] implements censorship-resistant URLs based on [[public-key cryptography]]: only a person having the correct private key is able to update the URL or take it down.

===Control over online tracking===
Anonymous P2P also has value in normal daily communication. When communication is anonymous, the decision to reveal the identities of the communicating parties is left up to the parties involved and is not available to a third party. Often there is no need or desire by the communicating parties to reveal their identities. As a matter of personal freedom, many people do not want processes in place by default which supply unnecessary data. In some cases such data could be compiled into histories of their activities.

For example, most current phone systems transmit caller ID information by default to the called party (although this can be disabled either for a single call or for all calls). If a person calls to make an inquiry about a product or the time of a movie, the party called has a record of the calling phone number, and may be able to obtain the name, address and other information about the caller. This information is not available about someone who walks into a store and makes a similar inquiry.

===Effects of surveillance on lawful activity===
Online surveillance, such as recording and retaining details of web and e-mail traffic, may have effects on lawful activities.<ref name="chilling">Dawinder S. Sidhu (2007). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1002145 The chilling effect of government surveillance programs on the use of the internet by Muslim-Americans]. University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class.</ref> People may be deterred from accessing or communicating legal information because they know of possible surveillance and believe that such communication may be seen as suspicious.

According to law professor [[Daniel J. Solove]], such effects "harm society because, among other things, they reduce the range of viewpoints being expressed and the degree of freedom with which to engage in political activity." <ref name="solove1">Daniel J. Solove (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565 "I've got nothing to hide" and other misunderstandings of privacy]. San Diego Law Review, Vol. 44.</ref>

===Access to censored and copyrighted material===
Most countries ban or censor the publication of certain [[list of banned books|books]] and [[banned films|movies]], and certain types of content. Other material is legal to possess but not to distribute; for example, copyright and [[software patent]] laws may forbid its distribution. These laws are difficult or impossible to enforce in anonymous P2P networks.

===Anonymous online money===
With [[anonymous money]], it becomes possible to arrange anonymous markets where one can buy and sell just about anything anonymously. Anonymous money could be used to avoid [[tax]] collection. However, any transfer of physical goods between two parties could compromise anonymity.<ref name="cymru">Rob Thomas, Jerry Martin (2006). [http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-12/openpdfs/cymru.pdf The underground economy: priceless]. Retrieved 2008-01-20.</ref>

Some{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that conventional [[cash]] provides a similar kind of anonymity, and that existing laws are adequate to combat crimes like [[tax evasion]] that might result from the use of anonymous cash, whether online or offline{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

==Functioning of anonymous P2P==
===Anonymity and pseudonymity===
Some of the networks commonly referred to as "anonymous P2P" are truly anonymous, in the sense that network nodes carry no identifiers. Others are actually [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]]: instead of being identified by their [[Internet Protocol|IP addresses]], nodes are identified by pseudonyms such as cryptographic keys. For example, each node in the [[MUTE]] network has an overlay address that is derived from its [[public-key cryptography|public key]]. This overlay address functions as a pseudonym for the node, allowing messages to be addressed to it. In [[Freenet]], on the other hand, messages are routed using keys that identify specific pieces of data rather than specific nodes; the nodes themselves are anonymous.

The term ''anonymous'' is used to describe both kinds of network because it is difficult—if not impossible—to determine whether a node that sends a message originated the message or is simply forwarding it on behalf of another node. Every node in an anonymous P2P network acts as a universal sender and universal receiver to maintain anonymity. If a node was only a receiver and did not send, then neighbouring nodes would know that the information it was requesting was for itself only, removing any [[plausible deniability]] that it was the recipient (and consumer) of the information. Thus, in order to remain anonymous, nodes must ferry information for others on the network.

===Spam and DoS attacks in anonymous networks===
Originally, anonymous networks were operated by small and friendly communities of developers. As interest in anonymous P2P increased and the user base grew, malicious users inevitably appeared and tried different attacks. This is similar to the Internet, where widespread use has been followed by waves of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and distributed [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Such attacks may require different solutions in anonymous networks. For example, blacklisting of originator network addresses does not work because anonymous networks conceal this information. These networks are more vulnerable to DoS attacks as well due to the smaller bandwidth, as has been shown in examples on the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network.

However, a conspiracy to attack an anonymous network could be considered criminal computer hacking{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Participants in the network interested in ensuring the continuous availability of it could collaborate to identify the source of abusive traffic, and further investigate or prosecute it. This could be done without compromising the anonymity of data in the network.

==Opennet and darknet network types==
{{Main|Friend-to-friend}}
Like conventional P2P networks, anonymous P2P networks can implement either opennet or [[Darknet (file sharing)|darknet]] (often named [[friend to friend]]) network type. This describes how a node on the network selects peer nodes:

* In opennet network, peer nodes are discovered automatically. There is no configuration required but little control available over which nodes become peers.
* In a darknet network, users manually establish connections with nodes run by people they know. Darknet typically needs more effort to set up but a node only has trusted nodes as peers.

Some networks like [[Freenet]] support both network types simultaneously (a node can have some manually-added darknet peer nodes and some automatically-selected opennet peers) .

In a friend-to-friend (or F2F) network, users only make direct connections with people they know. Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two "friends", without telling either of them the other's name or IP address. These "friends" can in turn forward the same file (or request) to their own "friends", and so on.
Users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity.

Some [[friend-to-friend]] networks allow the user to control what kind of files can be exchanged with "friends" within the node, in order to stop them from exchanging files that user disapproves of.

Advantages and disadvantages of opennet compared to darknet are disputed, see [[Friend to Friend]] article for summary.

==List of anonymous P2P networks and clients==
<!-- please keep this list in alphabetical order -->
<!-- please do not add any applications which do not allow file transfer without anybody knowing your IP, having a proxy which takes the blame is NOT anonymous, private nets are NOT anonymous -->

* [[Bitblinder]]
* [[Entropy (anonymous data store)|Entropy]] - a "[[Freenet]] alternative"
* [[Marabunta]] - for chatting only
* [[MUTE]] - file sharing
* [[RShare]] - file sharing

===Private P2P clients===
[[Private P2P]] networks are P2P networks that only allow some mutually trusted computers to share files. This can be achieved by using a central server or [[Direct Connect (file sharing)#Hubs|hub]] to authenticate clients, in which case the functionality is similar to a private [[FTP]] server, but with files transferred directly between the clients. Alternatively, users can exchange passwords or keys with their friends to form a decentralized network.

===Friend-to-friend clients===
[[Friend-to-friend]] networks are P2P networks that allows users only to make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.

===Hypothetical or defunct networks===
====Hypothetical====
The following networks only exist as design or are in development
* [[Crowds]] - Reiter and Rubin's system for "blending into a crowd" has a known attack
* [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/herbivore/ Herbivore] - a distributed anonymous [[Dining cryptographers protocol|DC]]-communication system, providing private file sharing and messaging, under development at the Cornell University.

* [[Bitblinder]] - a decentralised p2p anonymity software program which included Tor but with increased speed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Website is down and clients are no longer functional.

===Anonymous P2P in a wireless mesh network===
It is possible to implement anonymous P2P on a [[wireless mesh network]]; unlike fixed internet connections, users don't need to sign up with an ISP to participate in such a network, and are only identifiable through their hardware. Even if a government were to outlaw the use of wireless P2P software, it would be difficult to enforce such a ban without a considerable infringement of personal freedoms. Alternatively, the government could outlaw the purchase of the wireless hardware itself. Protocols for wireless mesh networks are [[OLSR]] and the follow-up protocol [[B.A.T.M.A.N.]], which is designed for decentralized auto-IP assignment. See also [[Netsukuku]].

<title>Anonymous internet banking</title>
<text>'''Anonymous Internet Banking''' is the name given to the proposed use of strong [[financial cryptography]] to make electronic [[bank secrecy]] (or more precisely [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] banking) possible. The bank issues currency in the form of electronic tokens that can be converted on presentation to the bank to some other currency. This concept has a long history in which [[free banking]] institutions have issued their own paper currency often backed by a physical commodity.

==History==
Whilst the academic study of trust relationships and systems has long been the forte of [[intelligence services]] such as the [[United States|American]] [[NSA]], the growth of the internet in the [[1990s]] and the contemporary declassification of related knowledge allowed for greater public discussion of the potential for anonymous banking services by groups such as the [[Cryptoanarchy|cryptoanarchists]] and [[cypherpunks]].  

==Implemented systems==
Examples of anonymous internet banking services and software that have already been implemented include:
*[[eCache]]: an anonymous bank operating over the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network.
*[[Bitcoin]]: distributed [[P2P]] cryptocurrency.
*[[Pecunix]]: an (optionally?) anonymous digital gold currency.
*[[Yodelbank]]: an anonymous bank built on top of various digital gold currencies which ended operations during November 2005.
*[[Open Transactions]]: Open-source software, including a library, server, and test client, implementing untraceable digital cash and anonymous numbered accounts.

==The underlying mathematics==
Anonymous internet banking depends on the mathematics of [[public key cryptography]] and [[blind signature]] algorithms.  In this simple example we have [[Alice and Bob]] and a banker.  The banker generates an [[RSA]] public key with modulus <math>n= P Q</math>, where <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> are large [[Prime number|primes]], making <math>n</math> a [[semiprime]].  As described in [[RSA#Operation|RSA operation]], the bank also generates public key exponent <math>e</math> and private key exponent <math>d</math>.

Bob asks the banker for a $100 [[deposit slip]] in anticipation of Alice wanting to transfer money to him.  To generate a deposit slip the bank selects a large, globally unique [[random number]] <math>R</math> and encrypts it using the bank's public key; this means that it can only be decrypted with the bank's secret key:

<math>R' = R^e\pmod n</math>

This encrypted value <math>R'</math> is sent to Bob with the promise to deposit $100 into his account when Bob sends the value <math>R</math> back to the bank.  The bank is confident that Bob won't be able to break RSA to generate <math>R</math> from <math>R'</math> within the [[heat death of the universe]] without knowledge of <math>d</math>, so it does not worry about handing out the deposit slips without receiving anything from Bob.

When Alice wants to pay Bob $100 she asks for the deposit slip and Bob sends her <math>R'</math>.  Alice selects a large random value <math>w</math> coprime with <math>n</math> (so as to have an inverse modulo <math>n</math>) and uses it to [[Blind_signature|blind]] <math>R''=w^e*R'</math> and sends it to the bank to be [[Blind_signature|blind signed]].  The Bank charges Alice $100 for this operation and returns the blind signed value <math>R'''</math>.  Due to the symmetric properties of RSA, this provides her with <math>R</math>:

<math>
\begin{align}
R''' &amp; = (w^e*R')^d \pmod n \\
     &amp; = (w^e*R^e)^d \pmod n \\
     &amp; = (w*R)^{ed} \pmod n  \\
     &amp; = w * R \pmod n\\
\end{align}
</math>

Because of the blinding process, the Bank is not able to associate <math>R''</math> with <math>R'</math> or <math>R</math>, so it is unable to determine that Bob and Alice are doing business together, preserving the anonymity of the transaction.  Alice unblinds <math>R'''</math> (by dividing it by <math>w</math>) to generate the original value <math>R</math>, which she sends to Bob.
Bob verifies that <math>R</math> can be encrypted with the bank's public key by computing <math>R' = R^e \pmod n</math>, which means that Alice has deposited $100 into the bank.  Bob then sends this value to the bank and the bank checks its records to be sure that <math>R</math> has not been already used.  If it has not, it deposits $100 into his account and updates its database that the unique value <math>R</math> has been redeemed.

Different public keys can be used for different denominations of currency so this system doesn't take appreciably longer for large transactions.

Note that if neither Alice nor Bob wishes the bank to know that they performed a transaction with each other, then it is hard for the bank to find out.  However, in order to ensure this is the case many people need to be making transactions at the same time.  Otherwise the bank can figure it out by the timing of the transactions, using [[traffic analysis]].

'''Ansford School''' is a school located in the town of [[Ansford]] which lies on the northern edge of [[Castle Cary]] in [[Somerset]], England. It contains 656 students from the ages of 11 to 16.<ref name="ofsted">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_providers/full/(urn)/123865|title=Ansford School|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> It is run by the head teacher Robert Benzie.

The main school was built in 1940 with additional rooms for science, technology, mathematics and modern languages being added in the 1970's.  A new £1.7 million Sports Centre was completed in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansford.somerset.sch.uk/facilities.html|title=Ansford School Facilities|publisher=Ansford School|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref>

The school has its own animated micro-series set around the fictional deaths of Mr Kershaw, a teacher at the school and has cameos from other school teachers as well including headmaster Mr Benzie. It was created by former student Callum Dower who has now departed from the school. The series is named ″Who killed Mr Kershaw?″.

Kevin Cruise, from series four of Britain's got talent, attended Ansford School. It is a great school with quality teachers. Many people have said how great a school it is.

<title>Answer set programming</title>
<text>'''Answer set programming''' (ASP) is a form of [[declarative programming]] oriented towards difficult (primarily [[NP-hard]]) [[search algorithm|search problems]].  It is based on the [[stable model semantics|stable model]] (answer set) semantics of [[logic programming]].  In ASP, search problems are reduced to computing stable models, and ''answer set solvers'' -- programs for generating stable models—are used to perform search.  The computational process employed in the design of many answer set solvers is an enhancement of the [[DPLL algorithm]] and, in principle, it always terminates (unlike [[Prolog]] query evaluation, which may lead to an [[infinite loop]]).

In a more general sense, ASP includes all applications of answer sets to [[knowledge representation]]<ref>C. Baral [2003] ''Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Declarative Problem Solving.''  Cambridge University Press.</ref><ref>M. Gelfond [2008] ''[http://www.krlab.cs.ttu.edu/Papers/download/gel07b.pdf Answer sets.]'' In: Handbook of Knowledge Representation, Elsevier, pages 285-316.</ref> and the use of Prolog-style query evaluation for solving problems arising in these applications.

==History==

The [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] method proposed by Dimopoulos, Nebel and Köhler<ref>Y. Dimopoulos, [[Bernhard Nebel|B. Nebel]] and J. Köhler [1997] ''[ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/documents/papers/ki/dimopoulos-etal-ecp97.ps.gz Encoding planning problems in non-monotonic logic programs.]'' In: Proceedings of ECP-97, Springer Verlag, pages 273-285.</ref> is an early example of answer set programming. Their approach is based on the relationship between plans and stable models<ref>V.S.Subrahmanian and C. Zaniolo [1995] ''[http://www.cs.ucla.edu/%7Ezaniolo/papers/iclp95.ps Relating stable models and AI planning domains.]'' In: Proceedings of ICLP-95, pages 233-247.</ref>. Soininen and Niemelä<ref>T. Soininen and I. Niemelä [1998]  ''[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~ini/papers/sn-faanmr98.ps.gz Formalizing configuration knowledge using rules with choices.]'' Technical Report TKO-B142, Laboratory of Information Processing Science, Helsinki University of Technology.</ref> applied what is now known as answer set programming to the problem of product configuration.  The use of answer set solvers for search was identified as a new programming paradigm in Marek and Truszczyński<ref>V. Marek and M. Truszczyński [1999] ''[http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/cs/9809032 Stable models and an alternative logic programming paradigm.]''  In: The Logic Programming Paradigm: a 25-Year Perspective, Springer Verlag, pages 169-181.</ref> (the term "answer set programming" was used for the first time as the title of a part of the collection where that paper appeared) and in [Niemelä 1999].<ref>I. Niemelä [1999] ''[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~ini/papers/lp-csp-long.ps Logic programs with stable model semantics as a constraint programming paradigm.]'' Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 25, pages 241-273.</ref>

==Answer set programming language Lparse==

[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/lparse.ps Lparse] is the name of the program that was originally created as 
a front-end for the answer set solver [http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/ smodels], and is now used in the same way in many other answer set solvers, including [http://assat.cs.ust.hk/ assat], [http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/clasp/ clasp], [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tag/cmodels/ cmodels], [http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/gnt/ gNt], [http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/nomore/ nomore++] and [http://www.cs.uky.edu/ai/pbmodels/ pbmodels]. ([http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/dlv/ dlv] is an exception; the syntax of ASP programs written for dlv is somewhat different.)

An Lparse program consists of rules of the form

<pre>
    &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; :- &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; .
</pre>

The symbol <code>:-</code> ("if") is dropped if <code>&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;</code> is empty.  The simplest kind of Lparse rules are [[Stable model semantics#Programs with constraints|rules with constraints]].

One other useful construct included in this language is ''choice''.  For instance, the choice rule

<pre>
{p,q,r}.
</pre>

says: choose arbitrarily which of the atoms <math>p,q,r</math> to include in the stable model.  The lparse program that contains this choice rule and no other rules has 8 stable models—arbitrary subsets of <math>\{p,q,r\}</math>.  The definition of a stable model was generalized to programs with choice rules.<ref>I. Niemelä, P. Simons and T. Soinenen [1999] ''[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~ini/papers/nss-lpnmr99-www.ps.gz Stable model semantics of weight constraint rules.]'' In: Proceedings of LPNMR-99, pages 317-331.</ref>  Choice rules can be treated also as abbreviations for [[Stable_model_semantics#Stable_models_of_a_set_of_propositional_formulas|propositional formulas under the stable model semantics]].<ref>P. Ferraris and V. Lifschitz [2005] ''[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/weight.ps Weight constraints as nested expressions.]''  Theory and Practice of Logic Programming, Vol. 5, pages 45-74.</ref>  For instance, the choice rule above can be viewed as shorthand for the conjunction of three "[[excluded middle]]" formulas:

:<math>(p\lor\neg p)\land(q\lor\neg q)\land(r\lor\neg r).</math>

The language of lparse allows us also to write "constrained" choice rules, such as

<pre>
1{p,q,r}2.
</pre>

This rule says: choose at least 1 of the atoms <math>p,q,r</math>, but not more than 2.  The meaning of this rule under the stable model semantics is represented by the [[propositional formula]]

:<math>(p\lor\neg p)\land(q\lor\neg q)\land(r\lor\neg r)</math>

::<math>\land\,(p\lor q\lor r)\land\neg(p\land q\land r).</math>

Cardinality bounds can be used in the body of a rule as well, for instance:

<pre>
:- 2{p,q,r}.
</pre>

Adding this constraint to an Lparse program eliminates the stable models that contain at least 2 of the atoms <math>p,q,r</math>.  The meaning of this rule can be represented by the propositional formula

::<math>\neg((p\land q)\lor(p\land r)\lor(q\land r)).</math>

Variables (capitalized, as in [[Prolog#Data types|Prolog]]) are used in Lparse to abbreviate collections of rules that follow the same pattern, and also to abbreviate collections of atoms within the same rule.  For instance, the Lparse program

<pre>
p(a). p(b). p(c).
q(X) :- p(X), X!=a.
</pre>

has the same meaning as

<pre>
p(a). p(b). p(c).
q(b). q(c).
</pre>

The program

<pre>
p(a). p(b). p(c).
{q(X):p(X)}2.
</pre>

is shorthand for

<pre>
p(a). p(b). p(c).
{q(a),q(b),q(c)}2.
</pre>

==Generating stable models==

To find a stable model of the Lparse program stored in file <code><filename/></code> we use the command

<pre>
% lparse <filename/> | smodels
</pre>

Option 0 instructs smodels to find ''all'' stable models of the program.  For instance, if file <code>test</code> contains the rules

<pre>
1{p,q,r}2.
s :- not p.
</pre>

then the command

<pre>
% lparse test | smodels 0
</pre>

produces the output

<pre>
Answer: 1
Stable Model: q p 
Answer: 2
Stable Model: p 
Answer: 3
Stable Model: r p 
Answer: 4
Stable Model: q s 
Answer: 5
Stable Model: r s 
Answer: 6
Stable Model: r q s
</pre>

==Examples of ASP programs==
===Graph coloring===

An <math>n</math>-[[Graph coloring|coloring]] of a [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] <math>G</math> is a function <math>color\ </math> from its set of vertices to <math>\{1,\dots,n\}</math> such that <math>color(x)\neq color(y)</math> for every pair of adjacent vertices <math>x,y</math>. We would like to use ASP to find an <math>n</math>-coloring of a given graph (or determine that it does not exist). 

This can be accomplished using the following Lparse program:

<pre>
c(1..n).                                           
1 {color(X,I) : c(I)} 1 :- v(X).             
:- color(X,I), color(Y,I), e(X,Y), c(I).
</pre>

Line 1 defines the numbers <math>1,\dots,n</math> to be colors.  According to the choice rule in Line 2, a unique color <math>i</math> should be assigned  to each vertex <math>x</math>.  The constraint in Line 3 prohibits assigning the same color to vertices <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> if there is an edge connecting them.

If we combine this file with a definition of <math>G</math>, such as

<pre>
v(1..100). % 1,...,100 are vertices
e(1,55). % there is an edge from 1 to 55
. . .
</pre>

and run smodels on it, with the numeric value of <math>n</math> specified on the command line, then the atoms of the form <math>color(\dots,\dots)</math> in the output of smodels will represent an <math>n</math>-coloring of <math>G</math>.

The program in this example illustrates the "generate-and-test" organization that is often found in simple ASP programs.  The choice rule describes a set of "potential solutions" -- a simple superset of the set of solutions to the given search problem.  It is followed by a constraint, which eliminates all potential solutions that are not acceptable.  However, the search process employed by smodels and other answer set solvers is not based on [[trial and error]].

===Large clique===

A [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a graph is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices.  The following lparse program finds a clique of size <math>\geq n</math> in a given graph, or determines that it does not exist:

<pre>
n {in(X) : v(X)}.
:- in(X), in(Y), v(X), v(Y), X!=Y, not e(X,Y), not e(Y,X).
</pre>

This is another example of the generate-and-test organization.  The choice rule in Line 1 "generates" all sets consisting of <math>\geq n</math> vertices.  The constraint in Line 2 "weeds out" the sets that are not cliques.

===Hamiltonian cycle===

A [[Hamiltonian cycle]] in a [[directed graph]] is a [[Path (graph theory)|cycle]] that passes through each vertex of the graph exactly once.  The following Lparse program can be used to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a given directed graph if it exists; we assume that 0 is one of the vertices.

<pre>
{in(X,Y)} :- e(X,Y).

:- 2 {in(X,Y) : e(X,Y)}, v(X).
:- 2 {in(X,Y) : e(X,Y)}, v(Y).

r(X) :- in(0,X), v(X).
r(Y) :- r(X), in(X,Y), e(X,Y).

:- not r(X), v(X).
</pre>

The choice rule in Line 1 "generates" all subsets of the set of edges.  The three constraints "weed out" the subsets that are not Hamiltonian cycles.  The last of them uses the auxiliary predicate <math>r(x)</math> ("<math>x</math> is reachable from 0") to prohibit the  vertices that do not satisfy this condition.  This predicate is defined recursively in Lines 4 and 5.

This program is an example of the more general "generate, define and test" organization: it includes the definition of an auxiliary predicate that helps us eliminate all "bad" potential solutions.

<title>Anthrozoology</title>
<text>{{zoology|Image:Dogsled_racing_Alaska.jpg}}
'''Anthrozoology''' is the study of [[human being|human]]-[[animal]] interaction ("animal" referring to all ''non-human'' animals), also described as the science focusing on all aspects of the human-animal bond<ref>[http://www.anthrozoology.org/ anthrozoology.org | Research in Human-Animal Interaction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a bridge between the natural and social sciences.<ref>[http://www.wiu.edu/users/micasd/documents/27_2003-11-05_2.doc] (DOC format)</ref>

Anthrozoology is a modern [[interdisciplinary]] and burgeoning field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including  [[anthropology]], [[ethology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of the reality of their interactions. 

[http://www.swabe.org/faq.htm swabe.org] comments: {{quote|In reality, there is little homogeneity in anthrozoological research, certainly as far as disciplinary approach, methodology and theory is concerned. The academic backgrounds of anthrozoological researchers can be extremely varied. There are, for example, social scientists, psychologists, zoologists, ethologists, historians, philosophers, veterinarians and even physicians studying the human-animal relationship.}}

It adds that anthrozoology may veer towards ethics, behavioral research, welfare and promotion, and many other areas within the human-animal interface.

==Example areas of study==
* The [[interaction]] and enhancement within [[Captivity (animal)|captive animal]] interactions.
* Affective (emotional) or [[relational bonds between humans and animals]] (which may range from having [[companion animal]]s to [[zoophilia]])
* Human [[perception]]s and [[belief]]s in respect of other animals.
* How some animals fit into human [[society|societies]].
* How these vary between [[culture]]s, and change over times.
* The study of animal [[domestication]]: how and why [[domestic animal]]s evolved from wild species ([[paleoanthrozoology]]). 
* Captive zoo animal bonds with keepers

<title>Anti-aliasing filter</title>
<text>An '''anti-aliasing filter''' is a filter used before a signal sampler, to restrict the bandwidth of a signal to approximately satisfy the [[sampling theorem]].
Since the theorem states that unambiguous interpretation of the signal from its samples is possible when the power of frequencies above the [[Nyquist frequency]] is zero, a real anti-aliasing filter can generally not completely satisfy the theorem.
A realizable anti-aliasing filter will typically permit some [[aliasing]] to occur; the amount of aliasing that does occur depends on how good the filter is and what the frequency content of the input signal is.

Anti-aliasing filters are commonly used at the input of [[digital signal processing]] systems, for example in sound digitization systems; similar filters are used as [[reconstruction filter]]s at the output of such systems, for example in music players.  In the later case, the filter is to prevent aliasing in the conversion of samples back to a continuous signal, where again perfect stop-band rejection would be required to guarantee zero aliasing.

The theoretical impossibility of realizing perfect filters is not much an impediment in practice, though practical considerations do lead to system design choices such as oversampling to make it easier to realize "good enough" anti-aliasing filters.

== Optical anti-aliasing filter==

[[Image:anti-aliasing filter.jpg|thumb|250px|Anti-aliasing and IR-reject filter from an older digital video camera]]

In the case of optical image sampling, as by [[image sensor]]s in [[digital camera]]s, the anti-aliasing filter is also known as an ''optical lowpass filter'' or ''blur filter'' or ''AA filter''.  The mathematics of sampling in two spatial dimensions is similar to the mathematics of time-domain sampling, but the filter implementation technologies are different.  The typical implementation in [[digital camera]]s is two layers of [[birefringent]] material such as [[lithium niobate]], which spreads each optical point into a cluster of four points.<ref>{{cite book

| isbn = 0240515900}}</ref>

The choice of spot separation for such a filter involves a tradeoff among sharpness, aliasing, and fill factor.  In a [[monochrome]] or [[three-CCD]] or [[Foveon X3 sensor|Foveon X3]] camera, the [[fill factor]] alone, if near 100% effective with microlenses, can provide a significant anti-aliasing effect,<ref>{{cite book

== Applicability of oversampling ==

A technique known as [[oversampling]] is commonly used in audio conversion, especially audio output.  The idea is to use a higher intermediate digital sample rate, so that a nearly-ideal digital filter can sharply cut off aliasing near the original low [[Nyquist frequency]], while a much simpler analog filter can stop frequencies above the new higher Nyquist frequency.

The purpose of oversampling is to relax the requirements on the anti-aliasing filter, or to further reduce the aliasing.
Since the initial anti-aliasing filter is [[analog circuit|analog]], oversampling allows for the filter to be cheaper because the requirements are not as stringent, and also allows the anti-aliasing filter to have a smoother frequency response, and thus a less complex phase response.

On input, an initial analog anti-aliasing filter is relaxed, the signal is sampled at a high rate, and then downsampled using a nearly ideal digital anti-aliasing filter.

== Bandpass signals ==
{{main|Undersampling}}
Often, an anti-aliasing filter is a [[low-pass filter]]; however, this is not a requirement.  Generalizations of the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] allow sampling of other band-limited [[passband]] signals instead of [[baseband]] signals – see [[undersampling]].

For signals that are bandwidth limited, but not centered at zero, a [[band-pass filter]] can be used as an anti-aliasing filter.  For example, this could be done with a [[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband modulated]] or [[frequency modulated]] signal.  If one desired to sample an [[FM radio]] broadcast centered at 87.9 MHz and bandlimited to a 200 kHz band, then an appropriate anti-alias filter would be centered on 87.9 [[megahertz|MHz]] with 200 kHz bandwidth (or [[pass-band]] of 87.8 MHz to 88.0 MHz), and the sampling rate would be no less than 400 kHz, but should also satisfy other constraints to prevent [[aliasing]].

== Signal overload ==
{{main|Clipping (audio)}}

It is very important to avoid input signal overload when using an anti-aliasing filter. If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the [[analog-to-digital converter]], even after filtering. When distortion due to clipping occurs after the anti-aliasing filter, it can create components outside the passband of the anti-aliasing filter; these components can then alias, causing the reproduction of other non-harmonically-related frequencies. In [[digital audio]], the resulting aliased distorted signal of "digital [[clipping (audio)|clipping]]" has a characteristic sound that can be easily recognized.

<title>Anti-gravity</title>
<text>{{redirect|AntiGrav|the EyeToy video game|EyeToy: AntiGrav}}
In [[physical cosmology]], [[astronomy]] and [[celestial mechanics]], '''anti-gravity''' is the idea of creating a place or object that is free from the force of [[gravity]]. It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in [[free fall]] or [[orbit]], nor to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift.

Instead, anti-gravity requires that the fundamental causes of the force of gravity be made either not present or not applicable to the place or object through some kind of technological intervention. Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in [[science fiction]], particularly in the context of [[spacecraft propulsion]]. The concept was first introduced formally as "[[Cavorite]]" in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', and has been a favorite item of imaginary technology since that day.

In the first mathematically accurate description of gravity, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means. However in the early part of the 20th century Newton's model was replaced by the more general and complete description known as [[general relativity]]. In general relativity, gravity is not a force in the traditional sense of the word, but the result of the geometry of space itself. These geometrical solutions always cause attractive "forces". Under general relativity, anti-gravity is highly unlikely, except under contrived circumstances that are regarded as unlikely or impossible. The term "anti-gravity" is also sometimes used to refer to hypothetical [[reactionless propulsion]] drives based on certain solutions to general relativity, although these do not oppose gravity as such.

There are numerous newer theories that add onto general relativity or replace it outright, and some of these appear to allow anti-gravity-like solutions. However, according to the current generally accepted physical theories and according to the directions of physical research, there are no indications for anti-gravity to be possible.<ref>Peskin, M and Schroeder, D. ;''An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory'' (Westview Press, 1995) [ISBN 0-201-50397-2]</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = [[Robert M. Wald|Wald, Robert M.]]| title = ''[[General Relativity (book)|General Relativity]]'' | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-226-87033-2 }}</ref><ref>[[Joseph Polchinski|Polchinski, Joseph]] (1998). ''String Theory'', Cambridge University Press. A modern textbook</ref>

The terminology "anti-gravity" is often used in [[popular culture]] as a [[colloquialism]] to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means. [[Ionocraft|Lifters]], which fly in the air due to [[electromagnetic]] fields, are an example of these "antigravity craft".<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_antigravity.html|accessdate=July 23, 2010|first=Clive|last=Thompson|publisher=''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]''|date=August 2003|title=The Antigravity Underground}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa081902a.htm|title=On the Verge of Antigravity|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}</ref>

==Hypothetical solutions==
====Gravity shields====
{{main|Gravitational shielding}}
One might consider the results of placing such a substance under one-half of a wheel on a shaft. The side of the wheel above the substance would have no weight, while the other side would. This would cause the wheel to continually "fall" toward the side above the plate. This motion could be harnessed to produce power for free, a clear violation of the [[first law of thermodynamics]]. More generally, it follows from [[Gauss's law]] that static inverse-square fields (such as Earth's gravitational field) cannot be blocked (magnetism is static, but is inverse-cube). Under general relativity, the entire concept is something of a [[non sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur]].

In 1948 successful businessman [[Roger Babson]] (founder of [[Babson College]]) formed the [[Gravity Research Foundation]] to study ways to reduce the effects of gravity.<ref>Mooallem, J. (2007, October). A curious attraction. ''Harper's Magazine,'' '''315'''(1889), pp. 84-91.</ref> Their efforts were initially somewhat "[[crank (person)|crank]]ish", but they held occasional conferences that drew such people as [[Clarence Birdseye]] of frozen-food fame and [[Igor Sikorsky]], inventor of the helicopter. Over time the Foundation turned its attention away from trying to control gravity, to simply better understanding it. The Foundation disappeared some time after Babson's death in 1967. However, it continues to run an essay award, offering prizes of up to $5,000. As of 2007, it is still administered out of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] by George Rideout, Jr., son of the foundation's original director. Recent winners include California astrophysicist [[George F. Smoot]], who later won the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in physics]].

====General relativity research in the 1950s====
{{Main|United States gravity control propulsion research (1955–1974)}}

General relativity was introduced in the 1910s, but development of the theory was greatly slowed by a lack of suitable mathematical tools. Although it appeared that anti-gravity was outlawed under general relativity, there were a number of efforts to study potential solutions that allowed anti-gravity-type effects.

It is claimed the [[US Air Force]] also ran a study effort throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s.<ref>Goldberg, J. M. (1992). US air force support of general relativity: 1956-1972. In, J. Eisenstaedt &amp; A. J. Kox (Ed.), ''Studies in the History of General Relativity, Volume 3'' Boston, Massachusetts: Center for Einstein Studies. ISBN 0-8176-3479-7</ref> Former Lieutenant Colonel [[Ansel Talbert]] wrote two series of newspaper articles claiming that most of the major aviation firms had started gravity control propulsion research in the 1950s. However there is little outside confirmation of these stories, and since they take place in the midst of the [[policy by press release]] era, it is not clear how much weight these stories should be given.

It is known that there were serious efforts underway at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], who formed the Research Institute for Advance Study.<ref>Mallan, L. (1958). ''Space satellites'' (How to book 364). Greenwich, CT: Fawcett Publications, pp. 9-10, 137, 139. LCCN 58-001060</ref><ref>Clarke, A. C. (1957, December). The conquest of gravity, ''Holiday'', '''22'''(6), 62</ref> Major newspapers announced the contract that had been made between theoretical physicist [[Burkhard Heim]] and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Other private sector efforts to master the understanding of gravitation was the creation of the Institute for Field Physics, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], in 1956 by Gravity Research Foundation trustee, Agnew H. Bahnson.

Military support for anti-gravity projects was terminated by the [[Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973, which restricted [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] spending to only the areas of scientific research with explicit military applications. The Mansfield Amendment was passed specifically to end long-running projects that had little to show for their efforts.

====Negative mass====
Under general relativity, gravity is the result of following a spatial geometry (change in the normal shape of space) caused by local mass-energy. This theory holds that it is the altered shape of space, deformed by massive objects, that causes 'gravity', which is actually a property of deformed space rather than being a true force. Although the equations cannot produce a "negative geometry" normally, it is possible to do so using a "negative mass". The same equations do not, of themselves, rule out the existence of negative mass.

Both general relativity and Newtonian gravity appear to predict that negative mass would produce a repulsive gravitational field. In particular, Sir [[Hermann Bondi]] proposed in 1957 that negative gravitational mass, combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the [[strong equivalence principle]] of general relativity theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy. Bondi's proof yielded singularity free solutions for the relativity equations.<ref name="Bondi">Bondi, H. (1957, July). Negative mass in general relativity. ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', '''29'''(3), 423-428.</ref> In July 1988, [[Robert L. Forward]] presented a paper at the AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 24th Joint Propulsion Conference that proposed a Bondi negative gravitational mass propulsion system.<ref name= "Forward">Forward, R. L. (1990, Jan.-Feb.), "Negative matter propulsion," ''Journal of Propulsion and Power'', '''Vol. 6''' (1), pp. 28-37; see also commentary Landis, G.A. (1991) "Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion," 'Journal of Propulsion and Power'', ''Vol. 7,'' No. 2, p. 304.</ref>

Every [[point mass]] attracts every other point mass by a [[force]] pointing along the [[line (mathematics)|line]] intersecting both points. The force is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the two [[mass]]es and inversely proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the distance between the point masses:
:<math>\mathbf{F_{12}} = G \frac{(-m_1) m_2}{r^2}\mathbf{r_{12}} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\mathbf{r_{21}} = \mathbf{-F_{21}},</math>
where:
*''<math>F_{12}</math>'' is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two point masses,
*''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]],
*|''m''<sub>1</sub>| &amp;gt;0 is the (negative) mass of the first point mass, the minus is put out to show negative force, ''m''<sub>1</sub> is actually 0
*''m''<sub>2</sub> &amp;gt;0 is the mass of the second point mass,
*''r'' is the distance between the two point masses.

Bondi pointed out that a negative mass will fall toward (and not away from) "normal" matter, since although the gravitational force is repulsive, the negative mass (according to Newton's law, F=ma) responds by accelerating in the opposite of the direction of the force. Normal mass, on the other hand, will fall away from the negative matter. He noted that two identical masses, one positive and one negative, placed near each other will therefore self-accelerate in the direction of the line between them, with the negative mass chasing after the positive mass.<ref name="Bondi" /> Notice that because the negative mass acquires negative [[kinetic energy]], the total energy of the accelerating masses remains at zero. Forward pointed out that the self-acceleration effect is due to the negative inertial mass, and could be seen induced without the gravitational forces between the particles.<ref name="Forward" />

The [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, which describes all presently known forms of matter, does not include negative mass. Although cosmological [[dark matter]] may consist of particles outside the Standard Model whose nature is unknown, their mass is ostensibly known - since they were postulated from their gravitational effects on surrounding objects, which implies their mass is positive. (The proposed cosmological [[dark energy]], on the other hand, is more complicated, since according to general relativity the effects of both its energy density and its negative pressure contribute to its gravitational effect.)

====Fifth force====
Under general relativity any form of energy couples with spacetime to create the geometries that cause gravity. A longstanding question was whether or not these same equations applied to [[antimatter]]. The issue was considered solved in 1960 with the development of [[CPT symmetry]], which demonstrated that antimatter follows the same laws of physics as "normal" matter, and therefore has positive energy content and also causes (and reacts to) gravity like normal matter.

For much of the later quarter of the 20th century, the physics community has been involved in an attempt to produce a [[unified field theory]], a single physical theory that explains the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Scientists have made progress in [[grand unification theory|unifying the three quantum forces]], but gravity has remained "the problem" in every attempt. This has not stopped any number of such attempts being made, however.

Generally these attempts tried to "quantize gravity" by positing a particle, the [[graviton]], that carried gravity in the same way that [[photon]]s (light) carry electromagnetism. Simple attempts along this direction all failed, however, leading to more complex examples that attempted to account for these problems. Two of these, [[supersymmetry]] and the relativity related [[supergravity]], both required the existence of an extremely weak "fifth force" carried by a [[graviphoton]], which coupled together several "loose ends" in quantum field theory, in an organized manner. As a side effect, both theories also all but required that antimatter be affected by this fifth force in a way similar to anti-gravity, dictating repulsion away from mass. Several experiments were carried out in the 1990s to measure this effect, but none yielded positive results.<ref name="SciAm79">''Supergravity and the Unification of the Laws of Physics,'' by Daniel Z.

There are solutions of the field equations of general relativity which describe "warp drives" (such as the famous [[Alcubierre metric]]) and stable, traversable [[wormholes]]. This by itself is not significant, since ''any'' spacetime geometry is a solution of the field equations for some configuration of the [[stress-energy tensor]] field (see [[exact solutions in general relativity]]). General relativity does not constrain the geometry of spacetime unless outside constraints are placed on the stress-energy tensor. Warp-drive and traversable-wormhole geometries are well-behaved in most areas, but require regions of [[exotic matter]]; thus they are excluded as solutions if the stress-energy tensor is limited to known forms of matter. Dark matter and dark energy are not understood enough at this present time to make general statements regarding their applicability to a warp-drive. Many physicists such as Edmond S. Miksch of Harvard have theorized that dark matter has negative mass. There is considerable empirical evidence supporting this claim such as the results produced by Supernova Cosmology Project team in 1998.<ref>Choi, Hyoyoung; "Hypothesis of Dark Matter and Dark Energy with Negative Mass"; July 2009; http://vixra.org/abs/0907.0015</ref>

====Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program====
During the close of the twentieth century [[NASA]] provided funding for the [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (BPP) from 1996 through 2002. This program studied a number of "far out" designs for space propulsion that were not receiving funding through normal university or commercial channels. Anti-gravity-like concepts were investigated under the name "diametric drive". The work of the BPP program continues in the independent, non-NASA affiliated [http://www.tauzero.aero/ Tau Zero Foundation].

==Empirical claims and commercial efforts==
Anti-gravity devices are a common invention in the "alt" field, often requiring a completely new physics framework in order to work. Most of these devices rather obviously do not work, and are often parts of grander [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. However there have also been a number of commercial attempts to build such devices as well, and a small number of reports of anti-gravity-like effects in the scientific literature. As of 2007, none of the examples that follow are accepted as genuine, reproducible examples of practically applicable anti-gravity, at least by the larger physics community.

====Gyroscopic devices====
[[Image:H W Wallace force field figure 4.png|thumb|350px|A "kinemassic field" generator from {{US patent|3626605}}: Method and apparatus for generating a secondary gravitational force field.]]
[[Gyroscope]]s produce a force when twisted that operates "out of plane" and can appear to lift themselves against gravity. Although this force is well understood to be illusory, even under Newtonian models, it has nevertheless generated numerous claims of anti-gravity devices and any number of patented devices. None of these devices have ever been demonstrated to work under controlled conditions, and have often become the subject of [[conspiracy theories]] as a result. A famous example is that of Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] of Imperial College, London, in the 1974 address to the Royal Institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rexresearch.com/laithwat/laithw1.htm#art1|title=Eric LAITHWAITE Gyroscope Levitation|work=Rex research|publisher=rexresearch.com|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>

Perhaps the best known example is a series of patents issued to [[Henry William Wallace]], an engineer at [[GE Aerospace]] in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and GE Re-Entry Systems in Philadelphia. He constructed devices that rapidly spun disks of [[brass]], a material made up largely of elements with a total half-integer nuclear spin.<ref>[http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/fatcat/53/wallace.html METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A SECONDARY GRAVITATIONAL FORCE FIELD]</ref> He claimed that by rapidly rotating a disk of such material, the [[nuclear spin]] became aligned, and as a result created a "gravitomagnetic" field in a fashion similar to the magnetic field created by the [[Barnett effect]].

Hayasaka and Takeuchi had reported weight decreases along the axis of a right spinning gyroscope.<ref>Hayasaka, H. and Takeuchi, S. (1989). ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', '''63''', 2701-2704</ref> Tests of their claims by Nitschke and Wilmath yielded null results.<ref>Nitschke, J. M., and Wilmath, P. A. (1990). ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', '''64'''(18), 2115-2116</ref> A few years later, recommendations were made to conduct further tests.<ref>Iwanaga, N. (1999). Reviews of some field propulsion methods from the general relativistic standpoint.''AIP Conference Proceedings'', '''458''', 1015-1059.</ref>

Provatidis and Tsiriggakis have proposed a novel gyroscope equipped by couples of rotating mass particles that draw only the upper (or lower) 180 degrees of a circle, thus producing net impulse per full revolution. This is achieved by transforming the previously used circular orbit into a figure-eight-shaped path (symbol of infinity) of variable curvature that entirely lies on the surface of a hemisphere.<ref>Provatidis, Christopher, G. (2009). A novel mechanism to produce figure-eight-shaped closed curves in the three-dimensional space, 3rd International Conference on Experiments/Process/System Modeling/Simulation &amp; Optimization (3rd IC-EpsMsO), Athens, 8–11 July</ref> Moreover, it was claimed that the spinning of the entire mechanism, in conjunction with the resonance of the centrifugal force through two servomotors, produces antigravity propulsion towards the axis of symmetry of the aforementioned hemisphere.<ref>Tsiriggakis, V. Th. and Provatidis C. G. (2008).

G. (2010), A device that can produce net impulse using rotating masses, ''Engineering'', '''2'''(8), 648-657, open access refereed paper at http://www.scirp.org/journal/eng/.</ref>

====Thomas Townsend Brown's gravitator====
During the 1920s [[Thomas Townsend Brown]], a high-voltage experimenter, produced a device he called the "gravitator" which he claimed used an unknown force to produce anti-gravity effects by applying high voltages to materials with high [[dielectric]] constants. Although it was claimed that the device operated outside of [[working mass]], Brown abandoned this work and moved on to produce a series of successful high-voltage devices in the following years.

The [[Biefeld–Brown effect]] nevertheless lives on. A 1956 analysis by the Gravity Research Group and by a technical writer, under the pen name of Intel (1956), claimed the Biefeld–Brown effect was the primary theory tested by the aerospace firms in the 1950s, although it should be noted that "Intel" is an unreliable witness in this respect. It has remained a constant theme in the [[UFO]] field, and has recently been a topic of some discussion in this field under the name [[ionocraft|lifter]]s. There appears to be a general understanding that the lifters require a working fluid, air specifically ([[ion wind]]), and that they do not demonstrate new physics. This was demonstrated on the American television show [[Mythbusters]], when the hosts were unable to reproduce the lifting effect with the device operated inside of a vacuum chamber.

====Gravitoelectric coupling====
The Russian researcher [[Eugene Podkletnov]] claims to have discovered experimenting with [[superconductor]]s in 1995, that a fast rotating superconductor reduces the gravitational effect.
Many studies have attempted to reproduce Podkletnov's experiment, always to no results.<ref>Li, N., Noever, D., Robertson, T., Koczor, R., and Brantley, W., "Static Test for a Gravitational Force Coupled to Type II YBCO Superconductors," Physica C, 281, 260-267, (1997).</ref><ref>Woods, C., Cooke, S., Helme, J., and Caldwell, C., "Gravity Modification by High Temperature Superconductors," Joint Propulsion Conference, AIAA 2001-3363, (2001).</ref><ref>Hathaway, G., Cleveland, B., and Bao, Y., "Gravity Modification Experiment using a Rotating Superconducting Disc and Radio Frequency Fields," Physica C, 385, 488-500, (2003).</ref><ref>Tajmar, M., and de Matos, C.J., "Gravitomagnetic Field of a Rotating Superconductor and of a Rotating Superfluid," Physica C, 385(4), 551-554, (2003).</ref>

In 1989, [[Ning Li]], of the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] theoretically demonstrated how a time dependent magnetic field could cause the spins of the lattice ions in a superconductor to generate detectable [[gravitomagnetic]] and gravitoelectric fields. In 1999, Li and her team appeared in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', claiming to have constructed a working [[prototype]] to generate what she described as "AC Gravity." No further evidence of this prototype has been offered.<ref>[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1281736.html Taming Gravity - Popular Mechanics<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.popularmechanics.com</ref>

====Recent progress====
The Institute for Gravity Research of the Göde Scientific Foundation has tried to reproduce different experiments which allegedly show an antigravity effect. All attempts to observe an antigravity effect have been unsuccessful. The foundation has offered a reward of one million euros<ref>[http://www.gravitation.org/institute_of_gravity_research/institute_of_gravity_research.html Institute of Gravity Research - Antigravity<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.gravitation.org</ref> for a reproducible antigravity experiment.

====Tajmar et al. (2006 &amp; 2007 &amp; 2008)====
A paper by [[Martin Tajmar]] ''et al.'' in 2006 claims detection of an artificial gravitational field around a rotating superconductor, proportional to the angular acceleration of the superconductor.<ref>M. Tajmar, F. Plesescu, K. Marhold, C.J. de Matos: [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0603033 Experimental Detection of the Gravitomagnetic London Moment]</ref> A subsequent paper claims to explain the phenomenon in terms of the nonzero cosmological constant.<ref>M. Tajmar, F. Plesescu, B. Seifert, K. Marhold: [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0610015 Measurement of Gravitomagnetic and Acceleration Fields Around Rotating Superconductors]</ref>

In July 2007, Graham ''et al.'' of the [http://www.ringlaser.org.nz/ Canterbury Ring Laser Group], New Zealand, reported results from an attempt to test the same effect with a larger rotating superconductor. They report no indication of any effect within the measurement accuracy of the experiment. Given the conditions of the experiment, the Canterbury group conclude that if any such 'Tajmar' effect exists, it is at least 22 times smaller than predicted by Tajmar in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web

==Conventional effects that mimic anti-gravity effects==
*[[Magnetic levitation]] suspends an object against gravity by use of [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] forces. While visually impressive, gravitation itself functions normally in such devices. Various alleged anti-gravity devices may in reality work by [[electromagnetism]].

*A [[tidal force]] causes objects to move along diverging paths near a massive body (such as a [[planet]] or [[star]]), producing effects that seem like repulsion or disruptive forces when observed locally. This is not anti-gravity. In Newtonian mechanics, the tidal force is the effect of the larger object's gravitational force being different at the differing locations of the diverging bodies. Equivalently, in Einsteinian gravity, the tidal force is the effect of the diverging bodies following different paths in the negatively [[curvature|curved]] spacetime around the larger body.

*Large amounts of normal matter can be used to produce a gravitational field that compensates for the effects of another gravitational field, though the entire assembly will still be attracted to the source of the larger field. Physicist [[Robert Forward|Robert L. Forward]] proposed using lumps of [[degenerate matter]] to locally compensate for the tidal forces near a [[neutron star]].

*[[Ionocraft]], or sometimes referred to as "Lifters" have been claimed to defy gravity, but in fact they use accelerated ions which have been stripped from the air around them to produce thrust. The thrust produced by one of these toys is not enough to lift its own power supply. Specifically, a special type of [[electrohydrodynamic thruster]] uses the [[Biefeld–Brown effect]] to hover.

*[[Muscle Pass]], magical technique.

    <text>{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}
    An '''anti-moose mat''' is an electrical mat used to keep [[moose]] away from certain areas. In October 2005, the municipal airport in [[Wasilla]], [[Alaska]] installed mats around the airfield to prevent moose from walking onto the runway and colliding with aircraft. A full-grown moose can weigh up to one thousand pounds, and can create many problems at some airports.  Therefore, the anti-moose mat can be very useful.
